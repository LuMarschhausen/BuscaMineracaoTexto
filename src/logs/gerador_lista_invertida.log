Texto: The significance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the
respiratory tract of 9 cystic fibrosis patients have been studied
by means of immunoelectrophoretical analysis of patients' sera for
the number of precipitins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the
concentrations of 16 serum proteins.  In addition, the clinical and
radiographical status of the lungs have been evaluated using 2
scoring systems.  Precipitins against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were
demonstrated in all sera, the maximum number in one serum was 22.
The concentrations of 12 of the serum proteins were significantly
changed compared with matched control persons.  Notably IgG and IgA
were elevated and the "acute phase proteins" were changed, the
latter suggesting active tissue damage.  The concentrations of 3 of
the acute phase proteins, notably haptoglobin, were correlated to
the number of precipitins suggesting that the respiratory tract
infection in patients with many precipitins is accompanied by more
tissue damage than the infection in patients with few precipitins.
The results indicate no protective value of the many precipitins on
the tissue of the respiratory tract.

Texto: Salivary amylase levels were determined in normal subjects from
birth until adult life and in children with conditions sometimes
associated with low pancreatic amylase such as malnutrition, coeliac
disease and cystic fibrosis.  Mixed saliva was collected under
carefully standardised conditions and amylase was measured by the
method of Dahlqvist.  There was a wide scatter of values in the 84
normal subjects, but concentrations rose from very low levels at
birth to reach adult levels by the age of 6 months to 1 year.
Salivary amylase activity rose normally over ten weeks in one
premature infant fed milk by gastrostomy.  Thirteen children with
coeliac disease and 9 children with cystic fibrosis mostly had
normal salivary amylase concentrations.  Six out of 12 malnourished
children with jejunal villous atrophy of uncertain aetiology had low
levels which rose to normal as recovery began.

Texto: This article reports on the possibility of using instrumental
neutron activation analysis (INAA) of sodium in nail clippings for
diagnosing cystic fibrosis (CF) in children and adults, for
detecting heterozygotes and for screening in the neonatal period.
Nail clippings from 1322 newborns, 22 CF patients (two of them
newborns), 52 healthy controls and 22 heterozygotes were analyzed.
The discrimination between CF patients and controls was found to be
precise for individuals above one year of age and INAA of nail
clippings should be accepted as a diagnostic test for CF after this
age.  Heterozygotes could not be detected by the method.  During the
first five days of life there is a big overlap between the values
from normal newborns and those of CF children, which makes the
method invaluable for early screening for CF.

Texto: Instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of nail clippings
was used in the development of a diagnostic method for cystic
fibrosis (CF).  From CF patients and controls more than three years
old, nail clippings were sampled for tests of different errors.  As
a result of this study a precise collection routine was outlined.
Sodium is easily washed out from nail clippings.  The risk of sodium
contamination of the nails seems to be small.  The sodium
distribution in the nail is inhomogeneous, and the sodium content
varies also from nail to nail in the same person.  There is good
evidence that the increased sodium in the nails of CF patients comes
from the sweat.  There seems to be a basic "intrinsic" sodium level,
which is about the same in the nails of CF patients as in controls.
The precision and accuracy of INAA for determining sodium in nails
is considered satisfactory.  It is concluded that INAA of the sodium
concentration in nail clippings is a suitable method as an aid in
the diagnosis of CF if a precise collection routine is used.

Texto: The capacity of duodenal juice to hydrolyse casein to
trichloroacetic acid-soluble peptides was investigated: in a control
group (11 infants and children and 7 adults); in 5 children with
pancreatic disease; in 10 children with enterogenic malabsorption
(coeliac disease and cow's milk protein intolerance).  The
proteolytic activity per ml duodenal juice in fasting condition was
as great in healthy infants and children as healthy adults (500-600
mg casein/ml/hour).  There was a good correlation between trypsin
content and proteolytic activity of duodenal juice.  In pancreatic
insufficiency, the proteolytic activity was extremely low (not
measurable in 3 patients) as was the trypsin activity whereas in
enterogenic malabsorption, it was within the ranges of the controls.

Texto: The influence of chronic Ps. aeruginosa infection on the occurrence
of bone marrow-derived lymphocytes (B cells) and thymus-derived
lymphocytes (T cells) in peripheral blood have been studied in 2
groups of patients with cystic fibrosis.  One group (9 patients)
suffered from chronic Ps. aeruginosa infection in the respiratory
tract and produced multiple Ps. aeruginosa precipitins which were
demonstrated by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis.  The other
group (9 patients) had never harboured Ps. aeruginosa in the
respiratory tract and presented no demonstrable precipitins against
this bacteria.  The lymphocytes were examined for the presence of
2 surface markers for B cells: receptor for C3 complement component
(EAC rosette-formation) and surface immunoglobulins
(immunofluorescent staining), and for the presence of 1 surface
marker for T cells: spontaneous binding of sheep red blood cells (E
rosette-formation).  The B:T cell ratio was nearly identical in the
2 groups of patients whereas the total numbers of B and T cells were
significant higher in patients with chronic Ps. aeruginosa
infection.  The number of Ps. aeruginosa precipitins per serum was
significantly positively correlated to the total number of T cells,
wheras the correlation with the total number of B cells was
insignificant.

Texto: The occurrence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the respiratory tract
of 70 cystic fibrosis patients and the occurrence of precipitins
against Ps. aeruginosa in sera from the same patients have been
investigated during one year by means of monthly bacteriological
examinations of tracheal secretions and by means of crossed
immunoelectrophoresis of a polyvalent Ps. aeruginosa antigen
against sera from the patients.  The one-year period prevalence
rate of patients harbouring Ps. aeruginosa was 64 per cent.  In
newly colonized patients and in intermittently colonized patients
non-mucoid strains were predominating, whereas mucoid strains were
predominating in chronically colonized patients.  The occurrence of
mucoid strains, especially in chronically colonized patients, was
associated with a significantly higher number of precipitins against
Ps. aeruginosa than the occurrence of non-mucoid strains.  Males
chronically colonized with mucoid strains presented a significantly
higher number of precipitins than females chronically colonized
with mucoid strains and the number of precipitins was correlated
with the duration of the chronic colonization with Ps. aeruginosa
in males in contrast to females.  The results are in accordance
with the hypothesis that mucoid substance could be a virulence
factor because it might inhibit the opsonizing effect of the
precipitins on the mucoid cells and the complement dependent lysis of
the cells hereby favouring mucoid strains at the expense on
non-mucoid strains in the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis
patients.

Texto: Seventy patients with cystic fibrosis treated as out-patients in a
cystic fibrosis clinic have been followed during one year by
monthly bacteriological examinations of tracheal secretions.  The
daily impression obtained in the laboratory is expressed by the
mean point prevalence rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 44 per cent,
Staphylococcus aureus: 39 per cent, Haemophilus influenzae: 17 per
cent, Diplococcus pneumoniae: 8 per cent, and miscellaneous other
bacteria, mainly Enterobacteriaceae: 8 per cent.  The fluctuations
of the bacteriology are described by additional epidemiological
terms: At one or more examinations during the study (period
prevalence rate), 90 per cent of the patients harboured St. aureus,
64 per cent Ps. aeruginosa (mainly mucoid strains), 64 per cent H.
influenzae, 37 per cent D. pneumoniae, and 30 per cent miscellaneous
other bacteria, mainly Enterobacteriaceae.  This pattern was found
in all age groups with minor age-dependent modifications, especially
as regards Enterobacteriaceae.  Ps. aeruginosa was predominating as
regards chronic colonization which reflects the most difficult
therapeutic problems, the period prevalence rate being 39 per cent
in contrast to St. aureus: 10 per cent, and H. influenzae: 1 per
cent.  St. aureus was predominating as regards new colonization and
recolonization which reflect the problems of prevention, the
incidence rate of new colonization and recolonization per risk group
being 84 per cent, followed by H. influenzae: 62 per cent, Ps.
aeruginosa: 43 per cent, and D. pneumoniae: 30 per cent.  The
results show that the bacteriological problems in cystic fibrosis
are still considerable as regards therapy as well as prevention.
Although many species may colonize the respiratory tracts of these
patients, the main clinical problems concern Ps. aeruginosa and St.
aureus; the reason why is discussed.

Texto: A family is presented in which celiac sprue and cystic fibrosis
occurred within the same sibship.  A cousin of the index case was
also discovered to have celiac sprue.  The genetics and incidence of
both conditions is reviewed.  It is estimated that the likelihood of
this association occurring on the basis of chance in this family is
1 in 50,000.

Texto: The prevalence of respiratory allergies and their effects on the
course of cystic fibrosis (CF) were studied in 63 patients.  Fifteen
patients (24%) had respiratory allergies as defined by history,
physical examination, positive allergy skin tests, nasal and
peripheral eosinophilia, and reversible airway obstruction.  Serum
immunoglobulins on these 15 allergic CF and 22 nonallergic CF
patients were elevated when compared with those in normal age-matched
controls.  The allergic CF patients had significantly higher IgE
levels (mean 598 international units [IU] compared to 281 IU); IgG,
IgM, and IgA levels were similar in the two CF groups.  The clinical
condition of the allergic CF patients, (Shwachman score) was better
than the nonallergic, suggesting some modulating effect of
respiratory allergy on the severity of the disease.

Texto: Taussig et al reported a case of a 6-year-old boy with the Russell
variant of the Silver-Russell syndrome concomitant with cystic
fibrosis.  We would like to describe another patient who had the
same combination of diseases.  The pattern of clinical findings in
this patient are in accordance with that of the Silver-Russell
syndrome.  It is, of course, possible that the development of
cystic fibrosis in this patient is entirely accidental, although
such a coincidence would be a statistically rare event.  The
establishment of a possible relationship between these two
conditions would depend on reports of other similar cases.

Texto: An intensive search for blacks with cystic fibrosis (CF) in
Washington, DC, during the period 1962 to 1971 disclosed 16 black
patients, eight of whom were born in the District of Columbia during
this decade.  The calculated incidence of CF is at least one in
17,033 black newborns.  The clinical course and pathological changes
in blacks with CF are similar to those in whites.  Genetic
considerations point to autosomal recessive inheritance in blacks,
which is generally accepted for whites with this disease.

Texto: Prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders has received increasing
attention during the past several years.  Rapid expansion of our
knowledge of the basis of genetic disease and the development of
reliable diagnostic methods have led to rapid advances in the
intrauterine diagnosis of a large number of inherited disorders.
Prenatal diagnosis was initially used to determine the presence of
Down's syndrome and other chromosomal abnormalities and for the
determination of fetal sex in pregnancies at risk for a number of
severe X-linked recessive disorders.  Shortly thereafter, it became
clear that the same techniques could be applied to the prenatal
diagnosis of a number of the inborn errors of metabolism.  Most
recently, a number of new techniques have been developed that may
prove to be of great value in the prenatal diagnosis of a number of
severe congenital malformations that before now could not be
diagnosed prior to birth.  The goal of this review is to define the
past achievements, future goals, and present limitations of
intrauterine diagnosis.  The first section will deal with the general
approaches used in prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders.  This
will be followed by a discussion of the specific applications of the
basic techniques to the intrauterine diagnosis of chromosomal
abnormalities and of the inborn errors of metabolism.  Approaches to
prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders include amniocentesis, direct
and indirect visualization of the fetus, analysis of maternal blood
and urine, and sampling of fetal tissues.  Applications of prenatal
genetic diagnosis include X-linked recessive disorders, chromosomal
abnormalities, inborn errors of metabolism, disorders of lipid
metabolism, disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, disorders of
mucopolysaccharide metabolism, disorders of amino acid metabolism,
and miscellaneous disorders such as cystic fibrosis.  These
techniques provide some parents with methods for having children
without fear of having a child with a specific deformity.  In
addition to the development of approaches which will increase the
number of disorders detectable in utero, the potential for treatment
of genetic disorders is unlimited.

Texto: Three of the 4 women in a cystic fibrosis clinic who used a combined
form of oral contraceptive developed acute polypoid cervicitis.  In
one woman, the polyp recurred on reinstitution of the medication.
There was resolution of the polyp in each instance on
discontinuation of the drugs.  In 2 of the 3 affected women, there
was coincidental deterioration of respiratory status.  Therefore, it
is suggested that cystic fibrosis patients who are using oral
contraception be observed closely regarding pulmonary and
gynecologic status.

Texto: The syndrome of ataxia-telangiectasia is characterized by ataxia,
progressive neurologic degeneration, cutaneous and conjunctival
telangiectasis, and immunologic deficiency.  Roentgenologic evidence
of chronic pulmonary and sinus infections and decreased lymphoid
tissue will usually be present.  As the sinopulmonary abnormalities
resemble those of cystic fibrosis, a small adenoidal mass may be of
differential aid.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis is no longer rare in adults.  The lung is the main
target organ and the basic lesion is bronchial obstruction leading to
bronchiectasis.  Interstitial infiltrates and cyst-like changes are
characteristic on roentgenography.  Complications include pulmonary
hypertension, pneumonitis, hemorrhage, and pneumothorax.  Little
correlation exists between respiratory tract and pancreatic and
gastrointestinal involvement, despite similarities in pathogenesis.
Pulmonary cystic fibrosis in adults does not always resemble the
condition in children, and must be differentiated from other chronic
interstitial diseases.

Texto: As far as rabbit alveolar macrophages are concerned,
the concentration of homozygous CF serum used in our experiments
was even greater than the fourfold concentration which Biggar and
associates state was required for normal phagocytosis.  Increasing
dilutions of homozygous CF sera with either Hanks balanced salt
solution or normal human serum, thus decreasing its concentration,
increased the capacity of the rabbit alveolar macrophages to
phagocytize and kill Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  Increasing
concentrations had just the opposite effect.  Suspension of rabbit
alveolar macrophages in human serum reduced their phagocytic
activity, but activity was reduced more by human CF serum than by
human normal serum.  This is not unexpected because high human
serum concentrations are likely to be toxic to rabbit alveolar
macrophages.  Because the inhibition of phagocytosis was absent
when homozygous CF serum more than 24 hours old or previously
heated or frozen was used and because of our observations that
dilution increased macrophage phagocytic ability, we feel our data
demonstrate the presence of a labile inhibitor rather than a
deficiency.  Since it is well known that CF patients have normal
or elevated concentrations of immunoglobulins including IgA in
their sera and pulmonary secretions and respond to infection, and
IgA has not been shown to be essential for alveolar macrophage
phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we cannot agree that this
inhibition is due to an IgA deficiency.  We also note that some of
the sera used in the experiments of Biggar and associates were
stored at -70 degrees C.  Perhaps this may account for the
difference in results.

Texto: We assayed the serum of a group of cystic fibrosis patients that
were on oral arginine therapy and that of a group of cystic
fibrosis patients that were not receiving this treatment for total
arginine esterase activity.  The untreated cystic fibrosis patients
have significantly lower serum arginine esterase activity than the
normal controls, the cystic fibrosis carriers, and the cystic
fibrosis patients receiving oral arginine therapy.  There is no
significant difference between the arginine esterase activity of
the normal controls and the cystic fibrosis carriers or the cystic
fibrosis patients treated with arginine. -  We have recently
observed differences in the arginine esterases in plasma of
controls and patients by electrofusing on polyacrylamide gels.
Six activity bands could be detected in plasma of controls, whereas
only five could be detected in plasma of patients.  Our work on the
deficiency of trypsin-like activity in mixed saliva of patients
with cystic fibrosis has been reproduced by another laboratory.
Coburn recently confirmed our work on deficiency of arginine
esterase in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis. At present, the
deficiency of arginine esterase in cystic fibrosis is a working
hypothesis to understand the basic defect. - The variations of pH
and sodium chloride content that I employed had been tested by me
in 6 patients both with and without a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis
and were found not to alter the level of arginine-esterase
activity.  The major differences between the two studies resulted
from the control subjects.  Dr. Rao neglects to mention the few
other laboratories that were unable to confirm his findings.

Texto: The ability to detect abnormalities of lung function in children
with asthma and cystic fibrosis by the measurement of closing
volume was studied in 205 children.  Flow volume characteristics,
routine spirometry, body plethysmography, and arterialized
oxygen tensions were studied for comparison with closing volume.
Closing volume was less sensitive in detecting disease than were
the residual volume to total lung capacity ratio, maximum expiratory
flow volume curves, and arterialized blood gases.

Texto: Five parents of children with cystic fibrosis developed allergic
bronchospasm after inhaling pancreatic extracts sprinkled on their
children's food.  There was a positive history of allergy, but no
past history of asthma in any of the 5 parents.  Asthma responded
to bronchodilators, and use of a face mask during preparation of
meals prevented recurrences.  To date, asthma precipitates by
inhalation of pancreatic extracts has not been seen in any of the
patients with cystic fibrosis.

Texto: Airway resistance and lung volume were measured by a modification of
the plethysmographic method of Briscoe and DuBois (1) to calculate
specific airway resistance (SRaw) on 263 control subjects ranging in
age from the newborn to 54 years.  the mean SRaw was lowest in the
newborn period and increased rapidly to adult levels during the
first years of life.  In each age group, the mean SRaw was lower for
females than it was for males.  No control subject had an SRaw
greater than 8 sec cm H2O.  A decrease in mean SRaw from 4.2 sec cm
H2O for females 5 to 9 years of age to 3.5 sec cm H2O for those over
18 years of age paralleled sexual maturation, but similar changes
were not observed in the males.  A direct correlation of SRaw with
clinical observations was found in young patients with various
degrees of pulmonary involvement because of cystic fibrosis.

Texto: Ciliated nasal polyp epithelium from patients with allergic rhinitis
and patients with cystic fibrosis was maintained in organ culture
for 168 hours.  Explanted epithelium retained its morphologic
characteristics and incorporated 35SO4 and 3H into blood group
specific glycoproteins that were secreted into the medium throughout
the culture period.  Labeled mucous glycoprotein was solubilized by
reduction and alkylation, then purified by gel filtration
chromatography.  Purified glycoprotein was further separated on
diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) cellulose columns into 3 blood group active
fractions.  These fractions had similar amino acid compositions but
differed in N-acetyl neuraminic acid and fucose content and in
relative incorporation of 35SO4 and 3H-glucosamine.  Blood group
glycoproteins from polyp epithelium of patients with allergic
rhinitis and cystic fibrosis were indistinguishable in many
respects.  However, the 35SO4 per 3H ratio of all 3 glycoprotein
fractions from patients with cystic fibrosis exceeded that of the
corresponding fractions from secretions of patients with allergic
rhinitis.

Texto: The pressure-volume behavior of the lung was studied in 24 patients
with cystic fibrosis.  Isovolume flow-pressure relationships were
measured in 7 of these patients, and a modification of the
flow-volume test was evaluated for detection of flow reduction in a
separate group of 63 patients.  Relative to results in a control
group of 31 normal subjects, 13 of the 24 patients had grossly
abnormal pressure-volume curves with excessive stiffness of the lung
near maximum volume and loss of recoil at lower volume.  Closing
volumes in these patients were often high enough to cause
significant disturbances in gas exchange and the elevated closing
volumes were quantitatively explained by the low values for elastic
recoil.  The modified flow-volume test detected mild flow reduction
in many patients who otherwise had normal pulmonary function tests.
Loss of recoil per se did not account for the low maximum expiratory
flows, since "upstream" resistances were high.  However,
pressure-flow curves were effort-dependent at high lung volumes even
in patients with severe airway obstruction, showing that time
constants of emptying varied widely in these patients.  It was
concluded that deterioration of lung function in cystic fibrosis
involves more than airway obstruction and that the worsening gas
trapping is explained by a progressive loss of lung elastic recoil.

Texto: Use of bland aerosols, particularly mist tents, in the treatment of
lower respiratory disease was reviewed and no convincing evidence of
efficacy was found.  This is not surprising because there is
evidence that mist tents deposit little water in the lower
respiratory tract.  Mist tents may be detrimental, in some cases,
because of bacterial contamination and because they can cause
bronchospasm.

Texto: Plasma arginine esterase activity was measured in 13 young adult
patients with cystic fibrosis and in 36 control subjects.  The
enzyme was activated by treating the plasma with chloroform and
ellagic acid in the manner described by Rao and associates (1).  No
difference was found either between the arginine esterase activities
of the patients with cystic fibrosis and the control subjects, or
between the degrees of activity inhibited by soybean trypsin
inhibitor.  Thus, the findings of Rao and associates of a deficiency
of arginine esterase activity in the plasma of patients with cystic
fibrosis were not confirmed.

Texto: In spite of the widespread clinical impression that pulmonary
physical therapy, including breathing exercises, is helpful in the
pediatric age group, objective demonstration of the value of the
various maneuvers is for the most part lacking.  There is evidence
that the volume of sputum produced over short periods of time in
patients with cystic fibrosis is increased when cough is accompanied
by postural drainage and pulmonary physical therapy, but the
long-term effect of the various maneuvers on the course of the
chronic pulmonary disease remains unknown.

Texto: An ear-nose-throat survey was carried out on 50 children aged 4 to
10 years with cystic fibrosis.  10% were shown to be transiently
deaf, associated with eustachian tube dysfunction.  There were no
confirmed cases of secretory otitis media.  10 children (20%) were
found to have nasal polyps or gave a history of polypectomy.  Though
a high incidence of middle ear problems in children with cystic
fibrosis has been reported in the U.S.A., neither deafness nor
secretory otitis media was found to be a problem in the group
studied.

Texto: Patients with cystic fibrosis have tocopherol deficiency presumably
as a result of steatorrhoea.  Evidence for possible muscular
involvement in cystic fibrosis patients is clinical (muscular
weakness and wasting in many patients), biochemical (creatinuria on
a creatine-poor diet, with reversal of this finding after ingestion
of tocopherol esters, accompanied by a decrease in creatine in
plasma and an increase in creatine in muscle), and pathological
(focal lesions in skeletal muscle resembling nutritional muscular
dystrophy, and ceroid pigment in smooth muscle).  Muscle strength
was measured with a bulb ergograph in 45 patients with cystic
fibrosis attending the clinics at the Babies' Hospital, Columbia
Presbyterian Medical Center, New York.  In a double-blind study, in
which half the cases received tocopherol orally, and the remainder
placebo, no significant increase in muscle strength was found in
those patients receiving tocopherol over a period of 6 months as
compared to the placebo group.  Blood tocopherol levels in the
treated group returned to normal.

Texto: The hypothesis that mist tent therapy decreases the viscosity of
sputum by direct liquefaction of the sputum in the lower respiratory
tract was tested in 6 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).  The first
night all patients slept without the mist tent and the first morning
sputum was collected for analysis.  The following 2 nights patients
were randomly allocated to a tent supplied by either a jet or
ultrasonic nebulizer.  The early morning sputum was analysed for
volume, viscosity, water content, and DNA content, an index of
purulence.  There was no relation between sputum viscosity and DNA
content, water content, or volume.  Furthermore, there was no
consistent relation between sputum viscosity or volume expectorated
and the presence or absence of an 8-hour stay in the tent with
either method of water nebulization.  These results therefore
suggest that mist therapy does not consistently influence sputum
viscosity or volume in patients with CF.  Above a sputum water
content of 90%, further increases in water content do not influence
viscosity.

Texto: Cellulose acetate strip electrophoresis was found to be not
sufficiently reliable to differentiate between normal and CF
meconium, but marked differences were obtained when quantitative
immunoelectrophoretic methods were employed.  Normal meconium was
shown to contain alpha1-antitrypsin and alpha1-antichymotrypsin and
most samples contained low concentrations of albumin, and measurable
amounts of a variety of other plasma proteins.  It is suggested that
quantitative immunoelectrophoresis could be used as a means of
confirming the diagnosis of CF if positive results are obtained when
meconium specimens are screened with test strips.

Texto: The coexistence of cystic fibrosis and coeliac disease has recently
been reported, and it has been suggested that cystic fibrosis may
predispose to the later development of coeliac disease.  The
diagnosis of coeliac disease is largely dependent upon the
demonstration of histological changes in the small intestine, but
jejunal biopsy may be distressing to a small child.  It is
suggested that food protein antibody studies may be of value in the
investigation of children with cystic fibrosis in whom gluten
sensitivity is suspected.  In the following case the decision to
perform a jejunal biopsy was made when these studies were positive.
Food protein antibody to cereal antigens, wheat, oatmeal, and
gluten, and to ruminant antigens, cow's milk, and calf serum were
persistently detected in the patient's blood.  Jejunal biopsy
showed partial villous atrophy with shortening, broadening, and
branching of the villi.  There was a satisfactory clinical
improvement after gluten restriction.

Texto: Neonatal peritonitis remains a dangerous condition.  Factors
complicating diagnosis and management include its low incidence, the
diversity of aetiological factors found, and the severity of
underlying or associated disease.  28 cases presenting since 1957 at
Southmead General Hospital were reviewed.  Thirteen aetiological
factors relating to mother or baby were found.  13 infants were
premature, 10 had severe respiratory problems at birth.  Maternal
hydramnios was present in 7.  6 babies had had exchange transfusion.
The commonest findings were gangrenous volvulus and cystic fibrosis.
Combined factors were often present.  The usual presentation is with
bilious vomiting, abdominal distension, and failure to pass normal
meconium.  4 cases had distended abdomens at birth.  Plain abdominal
x-rays are of great diagnostic value.  Pneumoperitoneum is diagnostic
but absent from early films.  Treatment is surgical.  Close liaison
with the paediatrician who sees the baby first is essential.  In
assessing results it is pointed out that many of these babies are
small and/or suffering from serious conditions such as haemolytic
disease, cystic fibrosis, or gangrenous volvulus.  8 cases were
considered unfit for surgery.  Of 20 submitted to surgery, 12
survived, mostly in the latter part of the series.

Texto: The value of detecting albumin in meconium as a screening
procedure for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been assessed on 34,228
samples in South Wales and North Staffordshire over a 4-year period;
simultaneously, four methods of detecting albumin were evaluated.
12 cases of CF were detected, detection rate being 60%.  The
incidence of the disease in the population screened was 1 in 1850,
confirmed by clinical and other test procedures.  Cases of CF
without impairment of pancreatic function are likely to be missed
by screening methods which depend on the presence of albumin in
meconium.

Texto: For Caucasians of European origin, cystic fibrosis (CF) remains the
commonest recognized autosomal recessive disorder, but it appears to
be a rarity among the coloured races.  For a time, records may have
suggested an association between CF and whiteness; in recent years,
however, instance of CF children have been described whose racial
origins are Negroid, Mongoloid, and non-European Caucasoid.  The
present case reports concern 3 Pakistani children born in Birmingham,
in whom Cf has been confirmed.  2 of the 3 (Cases 1 and 2) were
brother and sister.  The present incidence of this disease among
Asian immigrants in the West Midlands is approximately 1:10,000.

mucosa of chronic ulcerative colitis, in some juvenile polyps, and
around colloid (mucinous) carcinomas.  Moderate numbers of Paneth
cells are found in cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, ambeic colitis,
and in villous adenomas.  Paneth cells are sparse in diverticulitis,
in adenomatous polyps, and around nonmucinous carcinomas.  In this
study, Paneth cell metaplasia is associated with mucus
hypersecretion and mucin deposits.  It is suggested that one
function of the Paneth cell is to control gastrointestinal mucin
viscosity.

Texto: The effects of cystic fibrosis on 50 Victorian families with one or
more affected children were examined in a study carried out between
August 1972 and February 1973.  The social and emotional problems
experienced by family members, particularly the patients and
mothers, are reported on.  At all ages, socially embarrassing
symptoms and awareness of being different create major problems for
the patient.  The uncertainty of prognosis and doubts about the
prospects of employment are specially relevant for the teenager.
It is suggested that the patient be given ample opportunity, from
early adolescence onward, to discuss all aspects of his disease,
and that more appropriate provision should be made for the total
care of adult patients.  Many problems, such as depression, feelings
of isolation and the physical demands of constant treatment, which
the parents of children with cystic fibrosis experience, are
probably similar to those confronting parents of other chronically
ill and handicapped children.  But special difficulties stem from
the genetic basis of cystic fibrosis and from the knowledge of an
eventually fatal outcome.  The roles of professional members of the
medical team are touched on, particularly in relation to genetic
counseling and the provision of practical and emotional support to
parents.  Comments are made on the establishment of lay
organisations.  The financial strain associated with obtaining
regular medical attention was looked at, and suggestions are made
for minimizing the economic problems of certain vulnerable families.

Texto: Cultured lymphoid cells of both homozygotes and heterozygotes for
cystic fibrosis could be distinguished from those of normals by (1)
growth pattern, gross clumping, and (2) a relative increase in
dermatan sulfate, with a normal total mucopolysaccharide content.
Lines derived from the genetic mucopolysaccharidoses also had these
characteristics, but their total mucopolysaccharide content was
markedly increased.  These observations support the hypothesis that
the cellular disturbance in cystic fibrosis resides in those
cellular regions whose functions would be altered by
mucopolysaccharide composition.

Texto: Hereditary abnormalities of intestinal transport are rare conditions
but are of disproportionate importance because of the information
they give regarding the mechanisms of intestinal absorption in man.
The main disability is usually diarrhoea, but there may be
abnormalities from lack of absorption of an essential nutrient or
occasionally from absorption of compounds in excess due to failure
of a normal control mechanism.  These diseases are experiments of
nature which cannot be exactly simulated in the laboratory animal,
and thus may on occasions give information unobtainable from other
sources.  Most often, however, they confirm that the mechanisms of
absorption studied in detail in smaller mammals are probably
applicable to man.  In some of these diseases there is an associated
defect of transport in the proximal renal tubules as well as in the
gut.  They furnish evidence, therefore, that transport processes are
closely related in the gut and in the kidney, or at least that an
important step in transport is identical at the two sites.  Such
disorders include disorders of carbohydrate absorption, hereditary
defects of amino acid absorption, hereditary defects in the
absorption of fat, hereditary disorders of the intestinal absorption
of electrolytes, and hereditary defects of vitamin B12 absorption.

Texto: Elasticity of sputum.  Elasticity of sputum has been determined
using the Weissenberg rheogoniometer, by oscillatory testing, over
frequencies from 0.01 to 0.8 c/s.  Sputum was from patients with
either asthma, chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosis, or
bronchiectasis and, macroscopically, mucoid, mucopurulent or
purulent.  As in the viscosity plot over this shear rate range two
Zones with a junctional region can be distinguished.  In Zone 1,
over the lowest shear rates, elasticity increases slowly, changes
little over a "plateau" region and then, in Zone 2, increases
sharply.  In contrast to the viscosity plot, the plateau does not
show nothing.  By 0.8 c/s some samples show decreasing elasticity.
Although variance between samples is wide, there is no level of
elasticity characteristic of each disease or of one macroscopic
appearance.  Elasticity and viscosity are correlated, most
significantly at the lowest shear rates.  Asthmatic and
bronchiectatic sputa resemble each other in that this correlation
is still significant at higher shear rates, cystic fibrosis and
chronic bronchitic sputum in that it is not.  Since in these last
two mucous gland hypertrophy is present, it may be that the sputum
has a higher mucus component.

Texto: Concentrations of immunoglobulins were determined (using Mancini
method and WHO standard) in 108 sera taken during long term
treatment of 45 children with C.F. from 2 months to 16 years old.
They were shown to depend markedly on the clinical state of the
children particularly on the presence of pulmonary tract infectious
processes.  These infections caused a rise in immunoglobulin
concentration with predominance of IgM in C.F. children aged up to 3
yrs, and with predominance of IgG in older children.  Mean titer of
isohemagglutinins in children with C.F. was higher than in healthy
children.  Low titers of diphtherial and stapholococcal antibodies
were found.  In the case of anti diphtheria antibodies, this can be
attributed to the fact that these children are not regularly
vaccinated owing to their poor clinical condition.  As to the low
titer of antistaphylococcal antibodies this is a well known finding
in the course of chronic staphylococcal infections of appropriate
bacteriological tests in our C.F. children.  Furthermore their
lymphocytes showed an increased blastic transformation when
stimulated with staphylococcal filtrate.  Transformation of
PHA-stimulated lymphocytes was normal.

been conducted on 12 children with cystic fibrosis using Pancrex V
forte and Nutrizym tablets in equivalent dosage.  No differences
were found in the effectiveness of these products as measured by
stool volume, number of bowel actions, faecal fat excretion, and
urine urea excretion.  Neither product eliminated the steatorrhoea.
Though there was no laboratory evidence to support their choice nine
patients expressed a preference for Nutrizym at the conclusion of
the trial.  This preference was based partly on the smaller number
of tablets which are required.

young man with cystic fibrosis underwent broncho-pulmonary
lavage of an entire lung.  In spite of theoretical advantages, the
lavage produced an acute deterioration in the patient's clinical and

We conclude that bronchopulmonary lavage in cystic fibrosis may be
hazardous and should be reserved for those cases in which
conventional methods of improving tracheobronchial clearance have

studied in cystic fibrosis patients and in age-matched controls.  No
significant differences could be observed in either the

Contrary to previous reports, we found normal levels of the
Mg2+-dependent and Ca2+ + Mg2+-dependent ATPase activities in CF
preparations.  However, a qualitative difference was observed in the
Ca2+-dependent ATPase, since the enzyme had relatively greater
activity at lower calcium concentrations in the cystic preparations.
This effect on the membrane-bound Ca2+-ATPase is unlikely to
represent a genetic defect in the enzyme itself but it may be
connected with the mechanism of pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis.

Texto: Various aspects of the immune status were examined in patients with
cystic fibrosis (CF) and the following observations were made.  Ten
per cent of the CF patients had elevated or reduced serum IgG
concentrations and there seems to be a transient low serum IgA
concentration in the same number.  Serum IgM concentrations were
normal in CF patients.  Normal levels of the three serum
immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA and IgM) were detected in the siblings and
heterozygotes.  Serum IgE concentrations were elevated in 32% of
patients with CF but normal concentrations were detected in
heterozygotes and siblings.  Precipitating antibodies to various
antigens and allergens were detected in the sputum of most patients
with CF, but their sera contained lower or undetectable titres of
these antibodies.  The precipitating antibodies in CF sputum to
bacteria, to agar, to seminal fluid, to urine and to human serum may
be related to a common antigenic determinant of the glycoproteins
present in all these fluids.  The total protein concentration in the
sputum of CF patients seemed to reflect the extent of lung damage.
The third component (C3) of serum complement concentration was
normal, or moderately elevated in all CF patients tested.  Serum
transferrin concentrations were normal in CF patients but their
prealbumin levels were depressed, suggesting marginal
undernutrition.  Peripheral blood lymphocyte transformations with
PHA and PWM appear to be normal in CF patients.

Texto: In order to differentiate asthma from other disorders resembling it,
one should attempt to define clearly what we mean by asthma and
wheezing.  A most simplistic statement would define asthma as a
recurring form of dyspnea marked by wheezing breath sounds.  The
incompleteness of this definition is apparent: asthma is really a
symptom complex of labored wheezing breathing, characterized by
hyperreactivity of the bronchi to various stimuli, resulting in
generalized narrowing of the airways, variable in scope, and often
reversible by sympathomimetics, theophylline derivatives, and
corticosteroids.  A variety of conditions must be considered when
studying the wheezing child.  These include asthmatic bronchitis,
acute bronchitis, spasmodic croup, allergic cough, habit cough,
foreign body, cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis), right middle lobe
syndrome, and upper and lower respiratory tract conditions simulating

Texto: Chronic sinusitis in young children does not often invoke "sinus"
complaints of fullness, discomfort, or pain over the affected sinus,
for it is only the older child who verbalizes these complaints.
Rather, it is the secondary signs and symptoms that lead the
physician to suspect this entity in children.  The most common of
these are chronic nasal discharge and chronic nasal obstruction.  A
careful nasal examination is essential for the recognition of chronic
sinusitis, the most common predecessor of chronic sinusitis.
Allergic rhinitis is probably the second most common background of
acute and then chronic sinusitis.  Chronic sinusitis in children with
cystic fibrosis is a characteristic finding.  Sinusitis is common in
cleft lip and cleft palate children.  Infants and children with
clinical signs of chronic infection and radiographic changes should
have a nose culture and sensitivity studies to plan appropriate
antibiotic therapy.  Surgical therapy is indicated when the symptoms,
such as chronic pain, chronic otitis media, chronic bronchitis,
orbital infections, or intracranial complications, occur.

levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (AP) which were elevated by
age-related criteria.  Prominent liver isoenzyme bands were present
after polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of all 31 abnormal sera.
Larger than normal amounts of bone and intestinal AP were not
present in these sera.  These findings indicate that liver
abnormalities consistently are responsible for elevations of total
AP in sera of patients with CF.  Several causes of high liver AP
levels in CF patients were identified: chronic hepatic congestion,
drug hepatotoxicity, overt biliary cirrhosis, and most commonly
subclinical focal biliary cirrhosis.

Texto: "Asthma," according to the United States National Tuberculosis
Association, "is a disease characterized by an increased
responsiveness of the trachea and bronchi to various stimuli, and
made manifest by difficulty of breathing due to generalized narrowing
of the airways.  This narrowing is dynamic and changes in degree,
either spontaneously or because of therapy.  The basic defect appears
to be an altered state of the host."  The maxim, "All that wheezes is
not asthma," justifiably reinforces the importance of differential
diagnosis; indeed, the characteristic features of asthma may be found
to some degree in a wide variety of chest conditions or general
systemic diseases.  The purposes of this monograph are to review
those conditions that may be confused with asthma and to focus
attention on the specific points of importance in the history,
physical examination and laboratory test results that might provide

association with cystic fibrosis were treated with intramuscular
tobramycin 5 mg./kg./day in 3 divided doses.  The eight treatment
courses lasted 9 to 30 days.  Mean serum levels were 2.5 microg./ml.
at 1 to 3 hours and 0.2 microg./ml. at 7 1/2 to 8 hours after a dose
of tobramycin.  The mean tobramycin concentration in sputum was 0.3

isolates from sputum were either Pseudomonas sp. (64%) or
Staphylococcus aureus (18%).  Ninety-seven percent of Pseudomonas
sp. and 83 percent of Staphylococcus aureus were inhibited by 3.1
microg. tobramycin per ml.  No organism that was isolated before
therapy was observed to become resistant to tobramycin, although on
3 occasions colonization with new resistant gram-negative bacilli
occurred.  In 6 out of 8 courses of therapy patients showed clinical
improvement.  Elimination of bacterial pathogens from the sputum was
rarely achieved and was not necessary to produce clinical
improvement.  Colonization with resistant flora was an uncommon
finding.  Tobramycin's side effects were limited to local discomfort
at the injection site, nausea and vomiting.

in 88 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), and correlated with
bacteriological lung findings.  An increase of all serum globulin

albumin/globulin ratio were decreased.  The changes in all serum
protein fractions were significantly greater in patients with
constant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in the lungs than in
patients without this constant infection (p < 0.005), whereas
patients with intermittent pseudomonas infection did not have more
severe changes than patients without pseudomonas infection.  The
changes in gamma-globulin and total globulin were significantly

than in patients with rare Staphylococcus aureus infections (p <
0.005 and p < 0.05, respectively).  As regards the other serum
protein fractions, no significant differences between patients with
frequent and rare staphylococcus infections were found.  Judged by
simple scoring systems, the lung disease of patients with constant
pseudomonas infection was significantly more progressed clinically
and radiologically than that of patients without constant
pseudomonas infection (p < 0.00005), whereas no significant

Texto: Few studies of serum proteins by means of paper electrophoresis in
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have been published.  In these
studies alterations of the serum protein fractions were found, some
of which were significantly correlated with the clinical and
radiological severity of the disease.  In the present study, serum
proteins determined by paper electrophoresis in 95 patients with CF
have been studied and correlated with clinical and radiological
findings.  The serum proteins and electrophoretic patterns if 95
patients with CF were followed for 1 to 6 years in each patient.  For
CF patients as a whole, total serum protein was unchanged, whereas
albumin and albumin/globulin ratio were decreased and all globulin
fractions increased.  Total serum protein was increased in patients
with severe pulmonary disease.  The changes in total serum protein
and in all protein fractions were significantly correlated with
clinical and radiological severity of the lung disease.  All terminal
patients had severe changes.  Patients with complicating liver
cirrhosis had electrophoretic patterns that did not differ from those
of other CF patients.  It is concluded that the main cause for serum
protein alterations in CF is the lung affection, whereas liver
involvement and malabsorption probably are of much less importance.

in normal persons and in patients with cystic fibrosis.  Sweat
chloride values examined with Orion 417 direct-reading skin
electrode were collected in a group of 811 normal persons and a
group of 91 patients with cystic fibrosis and were evaluated for
differences attributable to age and sex.  In the normal group no

normal group the values among newborns are found to be considerably
higher than in the rest of childhood.  During the first month of
life the values decrease to a steady level, which is maintained from
the age of 1 month to 15 years.  After the age of 15 a steady
increase takes place.  With data gathered from the normal group we
propose the following upper limits of "normal" for the sweat
chloride test: 1 month - 15 years: Chloride 40 meq/l.  16 - 25
years: Chloride 55 meq/l.  Upon examination of the Cystic Fibrosis

above the upper limits of normal.  The method is found valuable for
large scale screening purposes for Cystic Fibrosis.

bicarbonate in relation to flow rate was investigated in a single
sweat gland of cystic fibrosis children.  The results show decreased
excretion of hydrogen-ions and an increased excretion of
bicarbonate.  Evidence is presented that due to reduced secretion of
hydrogen-ions in the duct both the reabsorption of sodium and the
secretion of potassium may be impaired.  Reduced flux of protons
across the luminal membrane of epithelial cells is proposed as a
general feature of exocrine gland defects.  It is then possible to
describe both the cationic transport defect of the sweat gland duct
and the anionic bicarbonate-secretory defect in one term.

Texto: Since 1900 improvements in general hygiene, and the development of
antibiotic therapy have enabled many of the epidemic infectious
diseases, particularly those of infancy and early childhood,
increasingly to be controlled.  In contrast, the morbidity and
mortality of diseases of genetic origin have been little affected.
The rational use of cell culture as an investigative technique in
inherited metabolic disease is rooted in the simple biologic truth
that, since a full complement of chromosomes is present in all
somatic cells, it should be possible to detect the specific
biochemical consequences of gene activity in cultured fibroblasts
unless, during the process of differentiation, genes are irreversibly
inactivated.  The usefulness of tissue culture in investigating
inherited metabolic disease does not rest with the biochemical
identification of the primary defect.  The cells in culture provide a
model system of the disease, which can be used to test the possible
effectiveness of therapeutic agents.  Tissue culture techniques
indicated that the cells derived from patients with cystic fibrosis
showed metachromasia.  Although the isolation and characterization of
cystic fibrosis from cystic fibrosis serum has not been accomplished,
a number of properties have been described.

every 2,000 white children born in the United States, and is now
generally regarded as the commonest serious metabolic disorder of
white children with the exception of diabetes mellitus.  Its
occurrence in children of Afro-Americans is quite rare and
exceedingly so in those of Oriental extraction.  Since cystic
fibrosis is genetically determined as an autosomal recessive trait,
and since the obligate heterozygote parent is entirely asymptomatic,
the disease on its first occurrence in a given family can only be
suspected by its manifestations in the patient himself.  At present
there is no test available for the detection of cystic fibrosis
which can be applied as a simple, practical screening test, such as
is available for phenylketonuria.  Diagnostic tests are, therefore,
used to confirm or refute the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis when
suggestive symptoms arise or when a sibling or relative is known to
have the disease.

heterozygote (PiZZ) mother were investigated.  In the newborn infant
the diagnosis of homozygote (PiZZ) deficiency of alpha1-antitrypsin
could be established in cord serum at the time of delivery.  Trypsin
inhibitory capacity (TIC) and alpha1-antitrypsin (AT) in cord serum
were in the range of adult homozygotes.  By means of crossed
immunoelectrophoresis exclusively, the phenotypic alleles ZZ were
demonstrable.  This excludes the possibility of materno-fetal
transfer of alpha1-antitrypsin.  In infant amniotic fluid extremely
low antiprotease-activity and substantially no alpha1-antitrypsin was
found, whereas in normal samples the TIC is 3% to 6% of the cord
serum values and the AT 1.2% to 4% of cord serum concentration.  Our
data suggest that a major component of TIC and AT in normal amniotic
fluid derive from the fetus.  In normal meconium we detected TIC and
AT in concentrations increasing proportionally to the total protein
content.  The inhibitory capacity of AT in meconium expressed in mg
trypsin inhibited per mg alpha1-antitrypsin however is 80% less than
serum alpha1-antitrypsin.  No correlation exists with the free
tryptic activity of meconium.  The AT of an PiZZ infant is clearly
diminished when referred to fresh weight, whereas meconia from three
cystic fibrosis newborns screened by the BM test had extremely high
concentrations.  Estimation of TIC and AT in meconium is regarded as
a useful approach for screening on homozygote alpha1-antitrypsin
deficiency.  The exact diagnosis however can only be established by
phenotyping the alleles.  In cystic fibrosis the high protein content
of meconium is accompanied by increased alpha1-antitrypsin levels.

Republic of Ireland - which does not yet have full returns of
hospital admissions - was approximately three times greater than the
number expected based upon the rates in England and Wales in
1969-71.  In Scotland the admission rates for coeliac disease were
about twice the expected number based upon the English rates.  This
contrasted with admissions for cystic fibrosis which were only
slightly higher in Ireland and in Scotland than in England and
Wales - evidence that the high admission rates for coeliac disease
represent a genuinely high rate in the community.  Admission rates
for coeliac disease were as high in the East and South of Ireland as

the staple diet before the great famine of the 1840s.  In
nineteenth-century Scotland, too, less wheaten bread was eaten than
in England and Wales.  In the past, therefore, coeliac disease
would not be as disadvantageous in Ireland, and to a less extent in

had a recorded history of tetracycline therapy were sectioned
vertically and horizontally.  Teeth in three representative
staining categories (mild, moderate, and severe) were photographed
under visible and ultraviolet illumination to determine the extent

Tetracycline incorporation into enamel was minimal or nonexistent,
whereas tetracycline incorporation into dentin was always observed.
The severity of general surface discoloration was directly related
to the proximity of the tetracycline incorporation to the
dentinoenamel junction.  This was dependent on dosage, duration, and
period of initiation of tetracycline therapy as it related to
odontogenesis.  Critical periods to avoid tetracycline therapy and
thereby to minimize potential tooth discoloration were determined.

developed to serve as a new test procedure for the diagnosis of
cystic fibrosis of the pancreas utilizing a more quantitative
approach for measuring, in a standard fashion, the volume of
secretion of the minor salivary glands of the lower labial mucosa,
which can be collected over a fixed period of time.  It was also
hoped that such standardization would facilitate the more accurate
study of all aspects of study of minor salivary gland secretion
collected in this fashion.  From the findings, it is obvious that
less minor salivary gland secretion was collected from cystic
fibrosis patients than from normal control subjects, using a
capillary tube test.  This may be due, in part, to an increased
viscosity of minor-salivary-gland saliva in cystic fibrosis.
Unfortunately, viscosity studies were beyond the scope of this
investigation.  The results indicate that the relative differences
between the volume of minor salivary secretion collected at a
standard test site and that collected over the total lower labial
mucosa are similar.  The volumetric differences in minor salivary
secretion have again been found to be distinctive enough to suggest
that studies be continued in this area to further refine a diagnostic
test procedure for cystic fibrosis of the pancreas.  At the present
time, studies are in progress to measure the volume of minor salivary
secretion at a standard test site employing an electronic technique.
It is hoped that this approach may permit the elimination of

typing has shown promise; because it is easily automated, it may
become the method of choice when very sensitive results are
required.  The value of pyocin typing appears to be well established
in the study of nosocomial infections; however, in some situations
it may give misleading results.  Further studies are required for
demonstration of the relative value and relationships of
serological, pyocin, and bacteriophage typing.

Texto: Study of the humoral antibody response of patients with cystic
fibrosis to the heat-stable O (and possibly K) antigens of
Pseudomonas aeruginosa revealed that these antibodies in
significant titers do not lead to eradication of the microorganism
from the respiratory tract.  In three out of six patients,
antibodies directed against the strains isolated from both sputum
and the lungs at autopsy were present in elevated titers.  The
antibody response to P. aeruginosa is strikingly affected by the
condition of the host and differs in patients with cystic fibrosis
or with one or another kind of malignancy.

Texto: Various techniques have been utilized for measurement of antibodies
against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  In general, the results of such
measurements tend to parallel each other, but the principal
functional antibodies against Pseudomonas appear to be opsonins of
the IgG and IgM immunoglobulin classes.  These antibodies are
potentiated by the complement system, activated either through the
"classical" or "alternate" pathways.  Susceptibility to fatal
infection with Pseudomonas is associated with antibody deficiency,
but this defect is usually correlated with other data regarding the
state of the host, such as underlying disease, immunosuppressive
therapy, and functional leukopenia.  Additional information is
needed on the relative protective role of IgG and IgM antibodies,
the affinity of such antibodies for viable bacteria, and the role of
antibodies against nonlipopolysaccharide antigens, such as protein
components of the cell wall and Pseudomonas exotoxins.

been developed.  Clinical trials revealed a decreased incidence of
sepsis and mortality due to Pseudomonas in vaccinated patients with
burns.  If vaccinated, certain groups of immunosuppressed patients
with cancer may also have a decreased incidence of death associated
with Pseudomonas.  Trials of parenteral vaccination in patients with
cystic fibrosis show little benefit.  Adverse reactions to this
vaccine are frequent and often limit the dose given.

Texto: We examined white cell cultures from 45 parents of CF patients (ie,
compulsory heterozygotes) to confirm if possible the existence of
an ametachromatic group (class III0 and the quantitate this class
in relation to the numbers of heterozygotes showing vesicular
cytoplasmic metachromasia (class I0 and generalized metachromasia
(class II).  Leucocyte cultures from the 45 CF carriers were set up
in parallel with similar cultures from 45 normal healthy controls.
The results confirm the value of the Toluidine Blue O metachromasia
phenomenon in white cell cultures as a method for heterozygote
detection in cystic fibrosis and suggest that it may be justified
to replace the tedious, expensive and time-consuming fibroblast
technique with the much simpler and more rapid leukocyte culture
procedure.  The simplicity and apparent reliability of the
leukocyte culture procedure as outlined here should facilitate
intrafamilial investigation and co-ordination of metachromasia
class with other parameters such as sweat electrolytes, ciliary
dyskinetic factor and clinical manifestations.  Such a study, if it
revealed distinct and consistent phenotypic correlations, might
furnish valuable additional evidence for genetic heterogeneity in
cystic fibrosis.

It is nevertheless hoped that in the near future, as a result of

ultimately be of value not only in identifying heterozygotes with
this condition but also in the handling and treatment of patients
with this common and disabling inherited disease.

Texto: Suspensions of Proteus vulgaris were rapidly agglutinated by serum
from cystic fibrosis patients.  Serum from obligate heterozygotes
exhibited a mean agglutination time that was significantly less than
that observed for 128 controls.  The agglutinating property was
observed to be transmitted through several generations and through
both maternal and paternal branches of the pedigrees.  Qualitative
differences were noted, with CF sera inducing the formation of
clumps that were two- to 10-fold larger than those observed in
heterozygotes.  The serum factor responsible for P. vulgaris
agglutination was heat sensitive, destroyed by pronase, and
neutralized by anti-human whole serum.  The CF serum retained
agglutinating activity following preincubation with anti-human IgG,
IgA, B1E, and B1A/B1C.

Texto: A strain of Staphylococcus aureus (no. FAR4) has been isolated from
a patient at frequent intervals over 18 months.  This strain has
previously been shown to lose resistance to several antibodies
(Lacey et al., 1973); during the last 6 months further changes have
occurred in it in vivo.  Lincomycin resistance appeared after the
patient had been treated with clindamycin.  This was due to mutation
to constitutive resistance to both lincomycin and erythromycin at a
locus adjacent to that determining "inducible" resistance to
erythromycin.  Both loci are probably carried by an extrachromosomal
element.  Three types of variation in the PF plasmid were observed.
Alteration in production of penicillinase from macroconstitutive to
microconstitutive, was not associated with any detectable change in
plasmid size.  This change gave the cell an advantage in vitro,
because it was associated with a faster growth rate and probably
also in vivo, because the microconstitutive variants were isolated
in increasing numbers after flucloxacillin therapy had ceased.
Complete loss of determinants for penicillinase production and for
resistance to cadmium ions from the PF plasmid was associated with a
decrease in plasmid size of about 4 x 10 6 daltons.  This change was
also associated with increased growth rate in vitro.  Loss of
resistance to fusidic acid from the PF plasmid was associated with a
decrease in plasmid size of about 1 x 10 6 daltons.

cystic fibrosis, occurring in as many as 4.5 per cent of such

presenting illness in infancy.  Cystic fibrosis patients with empyema
now constitute a significant percentage (approximately 3 to 7 per
cent) of the total number of patients hospitalized with empyema.
Since most of these empyemas occur in infancy and most are of
staphylococcal origin, sweat tests should be done on all infants
admitted with staphylococcal pneumonia with or without empyema,
particularly when recovery with adequate treatment is unduly

Texto: Fecal fat and nitrogen excretion were determined in 20 patients, 12
to 17 years of age, with cystic fibrosis (CF); all had pancreatic
deficiency.  Current clinical and nutritional status and growth
achievement in relation to fecal nutrient loss, age at diagnosis,
and adequacy of treatment were evaluated.  Steatorrhea and
azotorrhea were present to a variable extent (at times massive) in
all patients studied, but bore little relation to existing
intestinal symptoms, state of nutrition, growth achieved, or age at
diagnosis.  Many of the patients with better growth, nutrition, and
prognostic scores had been diagnosed relatively late in life and
presumably had not received adequate or optimal treatment.  Addition
of pancreatic supplements resulted in significant, but not dramatic
decreases in fecal losses of fat and nitrogen.  It was concluded
that despite pancreatic deficiency most older patients with CF need
little dietary restriction, although treatment should be
individualized.  Growth failure and state of nutrition seem to be
correlated more closely with the pulmonary state than with
pancreatic deficiency.  For ultimate prognosis, natural variation in
the severity of lung involvement is at least as important as early
diagnosis and adequate or optimal treatment.

was no peripheral edema or hypoproteinemia, although at necropsy
there was evidence of biliary cirrhosis.  Although the sweat
abnormality might have been due to as yet unknown factors, the
temporal association with cloxacillin administration suggests a
causative relationship, and it is tempting to speculate that the
anomaly was produced in this instance by the substitution of the
cloxacillin radical for the chloride ion in the sweat during the
period of therapy.  In light of our findings it would be of
interest to know whether the infant reported by MacLean and Tripp
was receiving any drugs at the time of the initial sweat chloride
estimations and whether sodium estimations were also performed.

cystic fibrosis (C.F.) and in a control group following stimulation
by an arginine infusion.  In controls the infusion of arginine
induced a prompt threefold elevation in plasma pancreatic glucagon
and about a sixfold increase in plasma immunoreactive insulin.  In
patients with C.F. the average response of both hormones was
considerably less, and the base-line concentrations for glucagon
were lower.  The data support the hypothesis that in C.F. both
alpha- and beta-cell function are affected as a result of the
underlying process.

Texto: The efficiency of delivery of an aerosol to 22 children with cystic
fibrosis, aged 8 months to 17 years, was investigated with the use
a standard ultrasonic nebulizer.  The study was designed to simulate
clinical conditions as closely as possible.  Retention of the
aerosol was monitored with a scintillation camera interfaced to a
small digital computer.  The children also had ventilation studies
with xenon-133, which allowed comparison of the distribution of
aerosol with regional ventilation.  The aerosol was visualized
within the lungs of all 22 patients.  Between 0.8 and 6.5 per cent
of the initial activity was deposited in the lungs, representing an
average of 0.27 ml. per therapy session or 0.0131 ml. per kilogram
of body weight.  There was a positive correlation (r = 0.89; p <
0.01) between increasing age and greater pulmonary deposition of the
aerosol.  There was decreased aerosol entry to regions which were
poorly ventilated.  The efficiency of aerosol deposition is variable
in children with cystic fibrosis, depending primarily on the age of
the patient, whereas its distribution within their lungs is related
to regional variations in the severity of the pulmonary disease.

the test should be repeated after the edema has disappeared.

Texto: Twelve patients with abdominal complaints had an operation that
included incidental appendectomy.  They were later diagnosed as
having cystic fibrosis.  Four groups of presenting signs and symptoms
were right lower quadrant mass, chronic abdominal pain, intestinal
obstruction, and hepatomegaly.  In all cases the symptoms
precipitating operation were due to the underlying unrecognized
condition: cystic fibrosis.  Review of the histology of the appendix
revealed the classic changes of hypersecretion of the mucous glands
to be present.  The appendix shares in the generalized intestinal
mucous gland involvement peculiar to cystic fibrosis.  Awareness of
this fact has not been widespread, perhaps because of the usual
emphasis on the pulmonary and pancreatic aspects of the disease.
Greater appreciation of the clinical symptoms of cystic fibrosis and
more liberal use of the sweat test could have diminished the number
of exploratory celiotomies.  Recognition of the histoloc changes in
the removed appendices can also suggest the proper diagnosis and lead
to earlier institution of treatment with an improved prognosis.

complex of anemia, hypoproteinemia, and edema.  Case reports of
seven infants between the ages of 1 to 4 months who developed these
abnormalities indicate that in several instances the children's
condition was misdiagnosed as milk-sensitivity or milk-allergy.
Furthermore, their case histories verify that their hypoalbuminemia
and anemia is nutritional and is corrected when a readily absorbed
diet with pancreatic-enzyme supplement is given.  A retrospective
review of feeding histories of 100 infants with cystic fibrosis, as
well as these case reports, indicate that affected children who are
breast-fed or fed with soy-based formulas are more likely to develop
the syndrome.

Texto: Since the report of an edema-anemia-hypoproteinemia symptom complex
in infants with cystic fibrosis, several articles have been
published.  We have also participated in the care of identical male
twins with this interesting symptom complex.  These twins offer two
more examples of the edema-anemia-hypoproteinemia symptom complex
of infant cystic fibrosis.  In the presence of transsupplementation
and the absence of hemolysis, the normal serum iron and increased
peripheral and marrow iron values suggest that the anemia results
from a defect at the level of hemoglobin synthesis, and that iron
transport remains sufficient in the face of protein depletion.
Possibly, a relative iron deficiency occurs after increased
nutritional intake due to increased utilization.  Lee suggested
that the hypoproteinemia is due to loss of protein in stools, but
these twins suggest that the problem lies not with losses through
urine or stool, but rather with failure in protein synthesis.  The
possibility of hypoproteinemia secondary to liver dysfunction is
attractive.  Although all liver function tests and biopsy findings
were normal, this is often the case in patients with cystic
fibrosis.  The anemia is associated with increased serum and marrow
iron values, and is most likely due to a decrease in hemoglobin
synthesis.  Routine cystic fibrosis therapy appears to be
sufficient for clinical recovery for all components of the symptom
complex.

also unusual because of the fortuitous association of cystic

was seen in seven patients.  The unexpected change, however, was the
presence of interstitial hyaline material in the media of the
pulmonary artery or its major branches in one-third of the
specimens.  The elastic fibers were distorted, but not disrupted,
and the finding was unrelated to the presence or severity of other
vascular changes.  Intimal deposits of the same material were also
present in seven of the patients with intimal proliferation in major
pulmonary arteries.  Identical medial lesions were found in the
pulmonary arteries of seven of 35 children with pulmonary

Whether the untoward effects result from excessive flooding of gut
and/or exceedingly high blood-amino acid levels is a matter of

radial immunodiffusion and found a significant rise of C3 but no
significant difference in C5 levels between these groups.  Using
immunodiffusion kits from the same manufacturer and freshly
obtained sera, we have observed quite different findings.  C5 was
mildly elevated in 20 and more highly elevated in 25 of 56 C.F.
patients, 2 to 29 years of age.  C5 was also elevated in 24 of 51
parents of C.F. patients, 15 showing mild and 9 higher elevations,
while 4 of 24 controls showed only mild elevation.  No correlation
was observed between serum-C5 levels, and the age, sex, clinical
severity of disease (judged by Shwachman-Kulczyki scores), sputum
bacterial colonisation, and mode of treatment of the C.F. patients.
The elevation of C3 and C5 in a majority of patients with C.F. and
obligate heterozygotes is very interesting and is suggestive of
certain genetic defect(s) in the complement activation system in
this autosomal recessive disorder.

Texto: The letter from Professor Elliott appears to be the first record of
skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis and may be an observation as
important as that of di Sant' Agnese when he noted the high salt
concentration of the sweat.  It seems that parents are well aware
of this response, and repeating Professor Elliott's observation by
soaking the hands of six infants with cystic fibrosis in hot water
showed that very marked wrinkling was present by five minutes and
often by two minutes.  This did not occur in control children of
similar nutritional state except in a case of twins - one with
cystic fibrosis, one without - where the unaffected child's fingers
began to wrinkle slightly by five minutes.  The wrinkling does not
appear to be associated with wasting due to malnutrition since it
occurs equally in plump and in thin infants with cystic fibrosis,
nor is it present in children with severe wasting and respiratory
disease not due to cystic fibrosis.

Texto: An unsolved problem in human population genetics is the high
frequency of the gene for cystic fibrosis (C.F.) in Caucasians.
Whereas the gene frequency is probably low enough in non-Caucasians
to be maintained by recurring mutation, this is not the case in
Caucasians, where the carrier frequency is approximately 1 in 25.
In order to establish a stable genetic polymorphism for a gene
where the homozygous state is lethal, some degree of heterozygote
advantage must exist, and it has been suggested that C.F.
heterozygotes have a higher reproductive fitness than normal
individuals.  It is not possible, of course, to know exactly how
stable the C.F. polymorphism is, and one cannot exclude the
possibility that some form of heterozygote advantage has existed at
some time in the past and no longer exists today.  We should like
to suggest a possible explanation which has much in common with the
generally accepted explanation for the very high frequency of the
sickle-cell gene in certain populations.  In the latter case,
heterozygotes have an increased resistance to a particular type of
malaria.  Patients with C.F. and heterozygous carriers have been
found to have, in their serum, a substance (probably a protein)
that agglutinates Proteus vulgaris.  Immunological cross-reactivity
between certain strains of Proteus (e.g., OX 19) and Rickettsia
prowazeki has long provided the basis of a serological test for
typhus (Weil-Felix reaction).  Thus it is conceivable that the C.F.
heterozygote might have an increased innate ability to counter
infection by R. prowazeki.  Although typhus is known in many parts
of the world, it seems to have been predominantly endemic and
epidemic in the temperate regions inhabited by Caucasian peoples.
Some areas where it is now endemic, such as South America, first
experienced the disease after it had been introduced by Europeans.
This would seem to be compatible with the observed higher C.F. gene
frequency in Caucasians than in other groups.

my previous note concerning skin wrinkling in cystic fibrosis.  The
range of normality varies in different climatic conditions, and in
Aukland wrinkling does not appear in cool tap-water (18-22 C) under
3 minutes in normals.  Skin wrinkling on immersion appears to be
age-related, but is difficult to detect reliably in the newborn.
Prior washing of the hands, or immersion in sea-water (even the day

Na2-35SO4 incorporation into cetyl-pyridinium-chloride

G.A.G.), we have found significant variation among C.F. patients
and their parents (obligate heterozygotes).  This biochemical
heterogeneity is comparable to what has been reported in fibroblast
cultures and serum.  The amount of Na2-35SO4 incorporated into
G.A.G. material found in both the incubation medium and the cells
from C.F. patients is significantly increased over normals.  A
similar analysis between normals and heterozygotes shows no
significant difference in Na2-35SO4 incorporation into G.A.G.
material of the cells.  However, 4 out of 6 heterozygotes appeared
to show a pattern of increased incorporation into material found in
the incubation medium (indicated by a higher mean than the normal
donors).  These results suggest yet another system to study the
effects of the C.F. gene.  The incorporation of Na2-35SO4 into
G.A.G. material of C.F. leukocyte cultures gives additional
evidence for the genetic heterogeneity in this disorder.

patients (age 18 - 33, 7 men and 7 women) and from 15 control
patients with bronchiectasis or chronic bronchitis in whom C.F. had
been ruled out.  In addition, the blood from 2 mothers
(heterozygotes) of C.F. patients was assayed.  The mean C3 level in
the C.F. men was slightly lower than that in the male controls,
whereas the C.F. women had a significantly higher mean level of C3
than did the female controls.  The C3 level in the C.F. women was
also significantly higher than that of the C.F. men (p < 0.01, t =
3.855 by the Student's t test).  The female controls had slightly
higher C3 levels than did the male controls, but this difference
was not significant.  Comparison of C3 levels from all of the C.F.
subjects to the controls shows considerable overlap in values,
especially in the men.  These studies suggest that an assay of
serum-C3 does not effectively distinguish C.F. subjects from
patients with other types of chronic lung disease.  However, the
differences between C.F. women and C.F. men is interesting and
deserves further attention.  Our data from C.F. young adults do not
fully confirm those reported by Conover et al., but it is possible
that the experimental effects of carboxypeptidase B observed by
Conover might result from action of the enzyme on the C.F. factor
of serum, although its identity most likely is not C3a.

all showed significantly greater uptake (p < 0.001) of 35S-heparin
than cultures from twenty-three normal controls.  There was partial
overlap in heparin-uptake values between C.F. patients and their
families.  This procedure thus differentiates C.F. families from the
normal population, but does not differentiate C.F. homozygotes from
heterozygotes.  It is hoped that either variations in culture methods
or a combination of this procedure with other measurements of C.F.,
such as ciliary dyskinesis or cellular metachromasia, will permit
unequivocal identification of C.F. carriers.

sign is highly reliable irrespective of the degree of nutrition of

Normal skin wrinkles eventually to exposure to water (except that

classical hypothesis for the bacteriology of C.F.  Since the
predominant flora of hospital nurseries is not now Staph. aureus
but rather gram-negative bacteria, it may be that the initial
exposure of C.F. patients is to an organism other than Staph.

Texto: It has been claimed that the nitroblue tetrazolium (N.B.T.) test is
of value in the surveillance of children with cystic fibrosis, a
positive test giving evidence of active bacterial infection which
may not be apparent clinically and not made evident by such
investigations as the white-blood-cell count, sputum culture, and
chest X-ray.  The test was therefore included in the routine
assessment of patients attending this clinic.  Of the total 269
N.B.T. tests, 110 were positive.  In only 57 of these cases was
there other evidence of infection; these 57 were treated with
antibiotics.  The remaining 53 were left untreated.  Of these, 41
remained completely free of infection by standard criteria at
subsequent review.  In 12 cases, however, the patient developed
obvious infection before the next clinic visit.  It could be argued
that in those cases the N.B.T. test had given early evidence of
infection not otherwise apparent.  This is by no means certain,
since the onset of infection could have been at any time during the
four-week interval.  In our experience, the N.B.T. has been of
little help in the management of cystic fibrosis.  There were in
this series 27% false-negatives and at least 37% false-positives,
some of which had very high counts.  It is possible, however, that
in 12 (i.e., 4%) of the tests carried out, the N.B.T. gave early

Furthermore, it was our impression that in normal individuals

Texto: The prevention of fetal malformations and abnormalities has long
been the hope of obstetricians, paediatricians, and geneticists, but
since the cause of most human malformations and of spontaneous gene
and chromosome mutations is unknown, this must remain a dream for
the present.  However, with the introduction of mid-trimester
amniocentesis it is now possible to detect some abnormalities early
enough for selective abortion of abnormal fetuses, though this
should be considered a temporary expedient only.  The abnormalities
which are amenable to this approach are the chromosome aberrations
such as Down's syndrome, the neural-tube malformations including
spina bifida cystica, and some recessively inherited and X-linked
metabolic disorders.

Texto: We have reported that red-cell glutathione reductase (G.R.)
activity is increased in cystic-fibrosis (C.F.) patients in
comparison with age and sex matched controls.  We have also
demonstrated that serum-G.R. activity is significantly greater in
C.F. than in controls, obligate heterozygotes, and patients with a
variety of respiratory and immunological diseases.  Moreover,
serum-G.R. from C.F. patients and carriers responds differently
from controls after storage or incubation with heparin.  We have
now examined G.R. in white blood-cells (W.B.C.) of C.F. patients.
The day after collection of samples mean W.B.C.-G.R. activity was
significantly less in the C.F. group than in carriers and controls.
No differences in G.R. activity between the groups was apparent
after 4 and 6 days.  White-cell G.R. activity apparently is lower
in C.F. patients than in controls.  We cannot rationalise this
decrease with the increased activity found in C.F. red cells and
serum.  Nevertheless, the differences between C.F. and controls are
of greater interest than the apparent directional contradiction.
The basis for quantatitive enzyme differences is very difficult to
determine.  The simplest explanation is that the initial white-cell
G.R. differences between C.F. patients on the one hand and controls
and carriers on the other are secondary to some aspect of the
disease or its treatment; but there is no evidence to support such
a conclusion.  These results, which reflect altered behaviour of
G.R. from C.F. patients, suggest to us that G.R. is involved in
C.F.

Texto: The water-binding capacity of a protein is minimal at its
isoelectric point (pH 3.5 - 5 for the keratins making up the horny
layers) and increases with increasing divergence from the
isoelectric point.  It is for this reason that normal palmar skin
wrinkles after moderate immersion in warm water, especially if it
is soapy (pH 8 or more).  However, in patients with cystic fibrosis
it is the increased salt content of the sweat rather than the pH
difference which increases the water-binding capacity of the
keratin, and is responsible for the wrinkling in these patients.

any inherited metabolic disease other than phenylketonuria should be
established beyond the few pilot studies at present in progress.  For
many diseases, although early detection is clearly desirable or the
technical means of screening are available, even the establishment of
pilot surveys is not yet indicated.  Instead, methods of screening
more limited populations at risk for particular disorders within a
nationally coordinated administrative structure should be
established.  Those with experience of mass screening for more than
one inherited metabolic disease must surely be convinced that in new

detection of cases or recognition of disorders whose management is
uncertain or unavailable can far outweigh any benefits.

Texto: In 1969 Danes and Bearn proposed that the metachromasia noted in
short-term white-blood-cell cultures from both cystic fibrosis
(C.F.) homozygotes and heterozygotes probably reflected uptake of
heparin from the culture-medium by pinocytosis and not, as in the
genetic mucopolysaccharidoses, stored mucopolysaccharides.  This
hypothesis was recently confirmed by Robertson et al.  Using
35S-heparin they demonstrated an increased uptake of heparin in
short-term C.F. white-blood-cell cultures which corresponded to the
observations made on the basis of staining.  However, as mentioned
in 1971 by Bafalluy et al., any white blood-cell in culture can be
overloaded with heparin.  As the processes involved in endocytosis
and exocytosis probably are inconstant within one cell and
certainly in different cell types, standardisation of cytoplasmic
retention of heparin may not be possible in order to eliminate the
partial overlap between normals, C.F. homozygotes and obligatory
heterozygotes observed by Robertson et al.  This report on
35S-heparin again raised the question of the significance of
cellular mucopolysaccharides in cystic fibrosis.  The relevance of
mucopolysaccharides in the C.F. cultured cell is still unclear.
Between 1968 and 1970 the mucopolysaccharide content of the
cultured fibroblast was reported as normal and variable.

Texto: Presumptive evidence indicates that the substance responsible for
the pathophysiologic conditions of cystic fibrosis (CF) is a
complement component, C3a, also known as anaphylatoxin.  The known
biochemical and physiological properties of C3a, together with the
behavior of this purified substance when associated with IgG in our
tracheal bioassay, compare favorably with those of molecular species
which  we have separated from sera and cell cultures of CF
homozygotes and heterozygotes.  Sera from normal healthy subjects,
previously inactive by bioassay for ciliary dyskinesia factor (CDF),
were converted to a CDF positive state by incubation with
epsilon-amino-caproic-acid (EACA).  EACA is a known inhibitor of the
carboxypeptidase-B-like anaphylatoxin inactivator, and is the method
of choice for accumulating anaphylatoxins in normal blood.
Incubation of EACA-treated normal sera and two fresh CDF-positive CF
sera with carboxypeptidase-B produced reversion in all instances to
a CDF negative, normal state.  It is proposed that anaphylatoxin
inactivator, a carboxypeptidase-B-like enzyme, is defective or
deficientin cystic fibrosis and that this deficiency is the primary
gene defect.

action in vitro on 16 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa tested.
This action, attributable to the oxidation of ascorbic acid, is
dependent on individual strains and the inoculum size.  In
combination with sulphamethoxazole, trimethoprim, Septrin,
ampicillin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol or colistin sulphate,
ascorbic acid acts synergistically on Pseudomonas aeruginosa in

combination show that the curvative dose 50 of ascorbic acid acting
alone is 11.22 milligrammes per kilogram body weight.  This was
significantly lowered (P =< 0.001) to 6.91 mg/kg if administered in
combination with erythromycin (10 mg/kg).  In human patients with
cystic fibrosis, by the combined administration of ascorbic acid
sulphamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Bactrim, Roche) the pseudomonas
infection could be controlled, as the viable number of organisms
significantly diminished during the therapy.

eccrine glands resulting in an increased concentration of sodium in
the sweat.  Because of possible complications in the erythrocytes
from CF patients, and since the activity observed in a cell
homogenate may not express the situation in the intact cell, we have
looked for differences in the binding of 3H-ouabain in cultured
normal and CF human diploid fibroblasts.  We observed no appreciable
differences in the number of ouabain-binding sites between normal
and CF cell strains.  We were also unable to observe any differences
in the kinetics of ouabain-binding between normal and CF fibroblasts
in K+-free phosphate-buffered saline solution, and the results were
essentially the same as those seen in HeLa cells.  We observed no
alterations in the kinetics of binding of ouabain nor any alteration
in the total number of binding sites.

Texto: Using the technique of 3H-ouabain binding to isolate cells Quissell
and Pitot concluded that the Na+-K+ ATPase functions normally in
fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis patients.  However this finding
may not be very relevant to the Na+ transport defect occurring in
this genetic disease.  The Na+ transport abnormality in cystic
fibrosis seems to be confined to exocrine glands.  It is unknown at
present whether the defect resides in an active or passive
transport step of the cation.  At least with isolated sweat gland
tissue and erythrocytes from cystic fibrosis patients, Na+-K+
ATPase activity has been found to be normal.  However a decrease in
the ethacrynic acid-sensitive efflux, a Na+ exchange mechanism, has
been reported in cystic fibrosis erythrocytes.  These findings
suggest that there is no fundamental abnormality in the Na+-K+
ATPase enzyme in the disease, but there may be a defect in an
ethacrynic acid-sensitive transport step.  Therefore in order to
obtain a better understanding of the cation transport defect one
should measure the binding of labelled ethacrynic-acid rather than
ouabain.

Texto: The nature of the metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis (CF) has, to
date, not been elucidated.  Elliott reported that intravenous
administration of soybean oil and lecithin to children suffering
from CF caused their sweat sodium concentration to decrease towards
normal values.  This prompted us to investigate the fatty acid
spectra of the various serum lipid classes of children with CF.  We
have found that affected children are deficient in essential fatty
acids.  The data suggest another approach to the study of the
metabolic defect in cystic fibrosis.  There is an apparent
deficiency in essential fatty acids, and a marked reduction in
serum vitamin E levels has also been reported in CF.  These
conditions might be partially corrected by intravenous injection,
or possibly feeding of, lipids containing essential fatty acids
with concomitant administration of vitamin E.  The observed
deficiency in essential fatty acids may be produced by a reduced
ability to absorb these acids from the diet and this, in turn, may
result in defects in membrane structure or stability.  Reduced
levels of vitamin E in CF may reflect a reduced requirement for
this vitamin because of the lower levels of essential fatty acids.
It is also possible that the observed deficiency in serum levels of
essential fatty acids may lead to less than normal production of
prostaglandins.

feces, but what is an excess?  To the physician, fecal losses may be
excessive when they cause the patient to be ill; to a parent a stool
pattern that differs from that of a neighbor's infant or even a
single watery stool may be too much.  New knowledge of normal gut
function and the pathologic processes that may afflict the child's
alimentary tract has improved one capability to diagnose and manage
certain specific diseases that cause diarrhea.  Although of great
interest to academicians, many of these diseases are extraordinarily
rare and in most practices there is a substantial and perplexing
pool of poopers in whom no specific disease can be found.
Fortunately, patients in this latter group are rarely seriously ill.
This article attempts to help the practitioner understand, diagnose

Treatment is geared at eradicating the Staphylococcus aureus from the

particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are treated when they become
pathogenic.  Other conditions such as atopia of the respiratory tract

fibrosis condition and must be controlled.  Pancreatic insufficiency
requires adequate enzyme replacement therapy to prevent steatorrhea

transport then their abnormal composition in cystic fibrosis may
require specific changes in the type of fat intake.  Salt depletion
should be looked for and corrected.  A screening test for cystic
fibrosis is needed, preferably one done on a small blood specimen.

Texto: The retrograde perfusion assay of Magos for the sodium reabsorption
inhibitory effect in sweat and mixed saliva from patients with
cystic fibrosis (CF) was modified by (1) using the second parotid
gland of the rat as a control, (2) carefully controlling the
quantity of saliva perfused into the rat parotid gland so that the
ratio of milliliters perfused to gram dry gland weight fell between
1.8 and 2.8, and (3) reporting the inhibitory effect as percentage
of inhibition of the rate of sodium reabsorption (RNa) in the
perfused gland calculated from the difference between the RNa's in
the two glands.  Using this modified assay we were able to confirm
that significant differences exist in the percentage of inhibition
of RNa caused by CF and normal mixed saliva (47.0 plus or minus 24.8
and 18.0 plus or minus 8.3, mean plus or minus SD).  In addition,
similar significant differences in the percentage of inhibition of
RNa by submandibular gland secretions (39.7 plus or minus 13.5 and
16.0 plus or minus 11.8), sublingual gland secretions (39.5 plus or

between CF and normal subjects were observed.  However, parotid
gland secretions from CF subjects showed no increased inhibitory
effect (12.5 plus or minus 7.9 and 12.5 plus or minus 6.6).  These
findings demonstrate that the sodium reabsorption inhibitory effect
is produced by the secretions from some but not all salivary glands

Texto: A calcium-precipitable protein (CaPP), previously shown to cause
turbidity of submaxilliary saliva (SMS) in patients with cystic
fibrosis (CF), was purified from normal and CF-SMS by (NH4)2SO4
precipitation, gel filtration, and preparative polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis.  This protein has a molecular weight of 12,000.  It
contains large numbers of serine, glycine, and glutamic acid
residues, 0.85% phosphorus as phosphate monoester, and small amounts
of carbohydrate.  Precipitation (aggregation) of CaPP occurs at basic
pH values in the presence of ionic calcium and is enhanced by
increasing calcium concentration, CaPP concentration, or pH.
Aggregated CaPP binds calcium in molar quantities equal to the
number of phosphate prosthetic groups.  Alkaline phosphatase removes
all phosphate from CaPP and eliminates calcium-induced
precipitation.  Studies of CaPP from CF saliva have demonstrated no
electrophoretic or compositional differences from normal CaPP.
Higher than normal pH values or elevated CaPP concentrations are not
present in SMS of patients with CF and do not contribute to the
formation of turbid SMS.  Aggregation and precipitation of CaPP in
saliva of patients with CF seems to be induced primarily by elevated
levels of calcium in saliva.  This precipitation may be entirely, or
in part, responsible for focal obstruction of submaxillary gland
ducts in patients with CF.  However, little or no CaPP is secreted
in the lower gastrointestinal or tracheobronchial tracts.
Therefore, CaPP does not play a more general role in the obstructive
processes which characterize CF.

erythrocytes (RBC) of subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF).  The RBC
membrane (Ca2+)ATPase activity of homozygous patients and obligate
heterozygotes was indistinguishable from that of normal control
subjects.  This was true similarly for total, ouabain-sensitive,
and ouabain-insensitive (Na+-K+)ATPase.  Total, ouabain-sensitive,
and ouabain-insensitive 24Na+ transport were normal in CF cells.
Ouabain-induced Na+ accumulation was similar in CF and normal RBC.
Measurements of K+ transport in CF RBC were, likewise, normal.  We
conclude that intrinsic ATPase and monovalent transport functions
are normal in CF RBC.  We were unable to confirm several
abnormalities in these cells reported previously.  The CF RBC is not
helpful in defining a transport abnormality in that entity.  These
studies document normal intrinsic transport function in RBC of
patients with CF.  There have been reports of an abnormal serum
factor in patients with CF.  This factor might be involved in the
production of a transport defect in CF.  Further studies are
indicated to determine whether CF plasma contains a factor capable

from 11 patients with cystic fibrosis(CF) and 12 age-matched control
subjects has been resolved into its component fractions by ion
exchange chromatography on DEAE-Sephadex and electrofocusing on
polyacrylamide gels.  The activity can be resolved into two
fractions by chromatography, one of which is inhibited by soybean
trypsin inhibitor (STI) and the other of which is not inhibited by
STI.  In plasma of CF patients, the fraction of activity inhibited
by STI is reduced to approximately 30% of the corresponding fraction
in control plasma.  In contrast, the fraction of activity resistant
to inhibition by STI did not show any significant quantitative
differences between control and CF plasma samples.  Analysis of
plasma samples by electrofocusing on 5% polyacrylamide gels in the
range of pH 5.0-8.0 and subsequent staining for arginine esterase
activity showed qualitative differences between control and CF
plasma samples.  Six activity bands could be detected in control
samples, whereas five bands were detected in CF samples.  Eight
samples had one type of band missing, two had another type of band
missing, and one had yet another type of band missing.  All of these
bands were restricted to a narrow pH zone in the center of the gel.
These data are consistent with and extend our earlier reports of
differences in arginine esterase activity between plasma samples of
CF patients and control subjects.  The demonstration of the absence
of a single band of arginine esterase activity is consistent with
the absence of a specific arginine esterase isoenzyme in patients
with CF.  The deficiency of arginine esterase in patients with
cystic fibrosis may account for the presence of "factors" in saliva,
plasma, and fibroblasts of these patients and consequently for the
clinical manifestations of the disease.

human fibroblasts is presented.  Cells from normal volunteers and
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were examined during exponential
growth by incubation with L-(methyl-14C)methionine and (3H)uridine.
The ratio of 14C to 3H counts per minute in isolated RNA serves as a
measure of the extent of methylation and was found to be similar in
normal and CF fibroblasts for tRNA, 18 S rRNA, and 28 S rRNA.
Hydrolyzed samples of (14C)-methyl-labeled RNA species were analyzed
by two dimensional chromatography and autoradiography.  The
methylated base and nucleoside compositions of tRNA and rRNA agree
well with data for HeLa cells and other eurkaryote cells such as
those from yeast, mouse, and chicken.  RNA methylation patterns in
CF fibroblasts were qualitatively and quantitatively similar to
those observed in normal cells for 4 S, 18 S, and 28 S RNA.  There
is no evidence that RNA species from patients with cystic fibrosis
are deficient in any methylated components.  Methylation of RNA by
tissue-cultured cells from cystic fibrosis is qualitatively and
quantitatively normal and will not prove to be a useful marker for
identification of carriers of cystic fibrosis.

24 controls were studied.  Flow rates at 50% and 25% vital capacity

the helium/air flow ratios were similar in CF patients and normal

0.05) in the CF patients.  The air and helium MEFV curves were
superimposed and the point where the curves crossed (point of
identical flow, PIF) was determined and expressed in % VC.  For the
CF patients, the mean PIF was 18% and for the controls, 5% (p <

Arterial oxygen tensions were below 86 mm Hg in four patients.
Closing volumes by the 100% helium bolus technique were normal in

undetectable in a moderate number of subjects is probably not of
pathophysiologic significance if the Ca really varies
unpredictably.  Sweat Ca, however, is generally believed to vary
with the rate of sweating, being much higher at lower rates, and
measurements made at comparable rates might well show significant
differences.  The authors did attempt to control rate, but in a
very inappropriate manner.  They measured no constant rate, but
took the average rate during the 30 minutes immediately after
iontophoresis.  This gives little information concerning the rate

have been made by evaluation of serum isoamylase patterns thereby
avoiding duodenal intubation or collection of 72-hour stools for
proteolytic enzyme activities.  The patients with normal pancreatic
enzyme activities had normal serum zymograms.  No CF patient had a
low total serum amylase concentration.  Total duodenal fluid amylase
levels may be misleading in the evaluation of pancreatic function
since the amylase may be of salivary origin.  The advantages of this

omissions from its spectrum.  MIC of sensitive strains is usually
less than or equal to 2 microg/ml although Pseudomonas may require
greater than or equal to 4 microg/ml.  The therapeutic range aimed
for is 2-12 microg/ml in serum and peak levels are measured 1 hr
after intramuscular and 20 min after intravenous injection.  Most
workers regard a level of 12 microg/ml as potentially toxic and try
to avoid exceeding it.

The role of the dietitian is to work as a member of the medical team.
Paediatric dietetics require rather more detailed advice and help for

Texto: This paper analyzes the cell cycle of cystic fibrosis-derived
fibroblasts and statistically demonstrates their failure to support a
normal population doubling time in vitro and indicates that this is
due largely to a failure of the cystic fibrosis-derived cells to
enter the cell cycle in normal numbers.  We have no explanation for
the significant difference in the behavior of these cells from
patients with cystic fibrosis vis-a-vis either normal or disease
control fibroblasts, save to conclude that it proceeds from an
intrinsic property of the cells themselves.

Texto: Twenty-five children aged 8 months to 17 years were studied to
determine the usefulness of computer-assisted ventilation-perfusion
(V-P) scanning in analysis of regional pulmonary function in cystic
fibrosis.  Ventilation and perfusion scintiphotographs were compared
with the patients' radiographs.  Regional fractional exchanges of
air and relative regional V-P ratios were obtained.  Whole-lung
air-exchange was significantly correlated with standard pulmonary
function tests and radiograph scores.  Ventilation-perfusion ratio
gradients were reversed in pats with predominantly upper zone
disease, and regional V-P ratios were uneven in distribution.
Quantitative assessment of regional ventilation and perfusion is a
useful technique for assessing severity of pulmonary disease in
children with cystic fibrosis.

Texto: Tobramycin treatment of chronic pulmonary infections caused by
Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 13 children with cystic fibrosis was
evaluated.  Initially the patients received the recommended dose
of 125 mg/m2/24 hours; the dose was then increased to 250 mg/m2/24
hours (approximately 10 mg/kg/24 hours).  This higher dosage was
administered intramuscularly to 9 patients.  Eight of these
received additional therapy with an aerosol containing tobramycin.
With this therapy it was possible to eradicate Ps. aeruginosa from
the respiratory tract in 5 of the patients.  After discontinuing
therapy Ps. aeruginosa re-occurred in all patients within one month.
All patients showed a clinical improvement in relation to therapy.
No toxic or allergic side effects were observed.

Texto: Thirty-five patients with cystic fibrosis (aged 11 months to 13.5
years) have been investigated with regard to respiratory symptoms,
respiratory tract pathogens, serum immunoglobulins and serum
precipitins.  Haemophilus influenzae was the commonest pathogen
being supplanted in advanced disease by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.  The
patients who had no respiratory infection had levels of IgG
significantly lower than normal children of comparable ages.  In
children with severe respiratory infection the immunoglobulins
were raised and precipitins to the predominant respiratory organism
were present.  These findings differ from the prevalent view that
patients with cystic fibrosis have a normal response to infection
and that the common infecting organism is Staphylococcus aureus.

Texto: To compare the in vitro susceptibility of mucoid and nonmucoid
Pseudomonas aeruginosa to gentamicin, 144 isolates of both mucoid
and nonmucoid P aeruginosa were cultured from throat swab and
sputum specimens from 29 patients with diagnosed cystic fibrosis.
Mucoid forms of P aeruginosa from throat swab cultures were all
susceptible to gentamicin, whereas only 85.5% of the mucoid strains
from sputum cultures were susceptible.  Nonmucoid strains from
throat swab and sputum cultures were 85.1% and 77.8% susceptible,
respectively.  Since the differences in susceptibility between the
four groups of organisms were not significant (P < 0.05), it was
concluded that these data show no real differences in susceptibility
to gentamicin between the mucoid and nonmucoid strains.

involved in mucoviscidosis.  Analysis of the genetic relations in
mucoviscidosis performed on 26 families bears witness to a monomeric
autosomal mechanism of transmission of the character.  In contrast to
other recessive diseases, parental consanguinity plays a secondary
role in mucoviscidosis, which apparently is explained by the wide
distribution of the mucoviscidosis gene among the population.  The
observations described may be utilized in medicogenetic consultations
given to members of those families where there are children suffering

Texto: It has been suggested that the development of goiter and
hypothyroidism in patients receiving chronic iodide therapy indicates
that they have underlying thyroid disease.  In 1971, Dolan and
Gibson, in a retrospective study, reviewed the records of children
with cystic fibrosis receiving chronic expectorant therapy with
iodide and reported that approximately 85 percent had goiter and 15
percent suggestive clinical findings of hypothyroidism.  This study,
together with the fact that the thyroid, like lung and pancreas, is
of endodermal origin raised the possibility that patients with cystic
fibrosis might have an underlying defect in thyroid function.  As
thyroid function in patients with cystic fibrosis has not been
evaluated in a systematic fashion, the present study was undertaken.
In it, we have evaluated basal thyroid function in a large group of
patients with cystic fibrosis and have, in addition, observed the
effects of chronic iodide administration.  The present study strongly
suggests that there often occurs in patients with cystic fibrosis
some derangement in thyroid hormone economy.  The frequency with
which iodides increased serum thyrotropin, decreased serum thyroxine
concentration, and induced goiter, with or without hypothyroidism, in
patients with cystic fibrosis, points strongly to the presence of an
intrinsic abnormality of the thyroid in this disease.  The nature of
such abnormality remains unclear.

Texto: The author has attempted to evaluate some of the methodology
currently in use or suggested for the routine determination of
vitamin A in blood and tissues.  Special consideration is given to
extraneous factors which can cause erroneous results in fluorometric
analyses.  A review of the older and current literature on the
distribution of vitamin A in tissues is presented.  Special
consideration is given to the uptake of vitamin A by the liver and
its storage in hepatocytes and Kupffer's cell and in subcellular
organelles.  Data on the concentration of vitamin A in the liver of
victims of accidental death and the effect of diseases of several
etiologies are presented.  The mechanism by which liver stores of
retinyl esters are mobilized and released to the plasma remains
obscure.  Considerable information has been gained recently on the
mechanism by which retinol is transported in blood.  Studies leading
to the isolation and characterization of retinol transport proteins
are summarized.  The metabolism of retinol binding protein in health
and in disease, especially in cystic fibrosis, is discussed.
Finally, some factors of importance to the interpretation of plasma
levels in terms of vitamin A are reviewed.  Special attention is
given to the effect on plasma levels of retinol and the retinol
transport proteins of periods of rapid growth (correlations with age)
and the influence of dietary adequacy on the distribution of plasma
levels of the vitamin.

patients with cystic fibrosis and other chronic lung diseases were
investigated histochemically for acid phosphatase,
beta-glucuronidase and beta-glucosaminidase activity, and also for
mucopolysaccharide content.  In macrophages from patients with
cystic fibrosis decreased beta-glucuronidase activity was observed,
together with large cytoplasmic vacuoles suggesting storage of
partially digested material.  It thus seems very likely that apart
from the increased synthesis of mucopolysaccharides described in
cystic fibrosis by several authors, the degradation of
mucosubstances produced can be impaired.

Texto: The electrical potential difference (PD) across the rectal wall was
measured in 26 patients with cystic fibrosis of pancreas (CFP) and in
18 healthy subjects. The PDs obtained in normal children were
identical to those previously obtained in normal adults. A
significantly greater dispersion of the values was observed in CFP.
When the patients were divided into groups according to metachromasia
in fibroblast cultures, the mean PD was increased only in the
ametachromatic group. True enough, this observation suggests a
difference between various forms of CFP, distinguished by
metachromasia, and thus is a further indication of the heterogeneity
of the disease. The greater abnormalities in metachromasia negative
patients may, however, be due solely to the fact that these patients
are more severely affected by the disease. The urinary excretion of
tetrahydroaldosterone in patients was within the ranges obtained in
controls, which excludes the possibility of secondary
hyperaldosteronism as the source of increased PD. No evidence was
provided in favour of a basic defect in the intestinal transport of
Na+ or Cl minus, but K+ concentrations in faecal fluids of patients
were significantly lower than in controls. The equilibrium
concentration of K+ could be accounted for by simple passive
diffusion, suggesting that the epithelium behaved inertly with
respect to this ion in CFP.

Texto: By measuring potential difference between rectal mucosa and perianal
skin using a reference electrode placed on the forearm, we
demonstrated an altered potential difference in cystic children
compared with control adults and normal children.  We suggested this
might be due to an alteration in the rectal mucosa potential or
altered skin potential, or both, in cystic fibrosis.  We measured
skin and rectal charges directly by connecting our reference
electrode to the blood stream through an intravenous line.  Using
this technique we showed that the cystic fibrosis patients (C.F.)
have an abnormal perianal skin potential difference compared with
readings we obtained in normal children.  There was little
difference in the transmural rectal potential difference between our
cystic patients and previously reported values in normal adults.
Thus the recent paper confirms our findings of normal polarity of
the rectal mucosa surface and the increased skin polarisation in
cystic fibrosis.

cirrhosis, were observed regularly for a period of 3 years and
various liver function tests, indicating cytolysis, cholestasis and
cellular insufficiency were performed. Immunoglobulin and prothrombin
were assayed. In 9 patients with cirrhosis, the tests were generally
abnormal. Two distinct biochemical patterns of cirrhosis were
distinguished, one clearly cholestatic and the other of a more
cellular type. The distinction was made on the basis of the IgA :
Transferrin ratio and of gamma-glutamyl-transpeptidase levels. In the
non-cirrhotic patients, a temporary increase of cytolysis and
cholestasis was observed in 50% of the cases.

Texto: A clinical study of the albumin content in meconium was performed on
two categories of newborn infants: a screening series of 8,830
infants and a high-risk group for Cystic Fibrosis (CF) of 70 infants.
A single radial immunodiffusion technique and test strips were used.
Three CF infants were detected in the screening series (1:3,000) and
16 in the high-risk group. The diagnostic accuracy for CF was fairly
good. The specificity was 99.8% for the immunodiffusion technique and
99.2% for test strips. A high concentration of albumin in meconium
was found not only in CF but also in preterm babies and infants with
gastrointestinal disturbances, such as atresias, malaena neonatorum
and malabsorption syndromes. The sensitivity was 90% for the
immunodiffusion technique and 78% for the test strip. False-negative
results were probably due to proteolytic activity and might be
avoided if the samples are stored at a low temperature before
analysis. CF screening of all meconiums by the use of test strips
followed by analysis of positive tests by the immunodiffusion
technique is suggested.

of Pseudomonas aeruginosa frequently observed in cultures from the
respiratory tract of chronically infected cystic fibrosis patients
have been studied. M cultures in vitro were unstable and easily
dissociated NM colonies. In a large proportion of the cases, M and NM
variants occurring simultaneously in cultures from one and the same
clinical specimen were of the same pyocine type, phage type, and
serogroup. In some remaining cases there were small differences
between the M and NM variants such that identity between the variants
from one and the same specimen was possible, although not definite.
The NM dissociants from M strains were of the same type as the M
variant. The possible role of cross-infection and the interaction of
bacteria and host response factors continuously tending to select the
unstable M variant in vivo are discussed.

Texto: The relative prevalence of mucoid strains compared with non-mucoid
strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been investigated in all
routine bacteriological specimens received in a department of
clinical microbiology during 1973. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was
isolated from 1054 of the specimens (5.7 per cent) representing 53
patients with cystic fibrosis (551 isolates) and 169 patients with
other diseases (503 isolates). The relative prevalence of mucoid
strains was significantly higher in specimens from patients with
cystic fibrosis (80 per cent) than in specimens from patients with
other diseases (3 per cent). Considering patients without cystic
fibrosis, the relative prevalence of mucoid strains was low in
specimens from all anatomical regions, and no special preference of
these strains for the respiratory tract could be demonstrated in
these patients, in contrast to the situation in patients with cystic
fibrosis. Alternation between mucoid strains and non-mucoid strains
in subsequent specimens was observed in 33 of the patients.

Texto: The occurrence of antibodies against antigens prepared from strains
representing 13 O groups of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and against a
polyvalent Ps. aeruginosa antigen (St-Ag) has been investigated in
sera from 100 patients. By means of fused rocket
immunoelectrophoresis with intermediate gel it was found that the
humoral immune response against Ps. aeruginosa resulting in
precipitating antibodies will be detected by St-Ag as well as by any
other of the antigen samples investigated. Six of the sera contained
group-specific antibodies which were revealed by only one of the
antigen samples used and not by St-Ag. These six sera were further
studied by means of various quantitative immunoelectrophoretic
methods using St-Ag as well as antigens prepared from the infecting
Ps. aeruginosa strain in the patient concerned. In all six sera, only
one extra precipitin could be detected using antigens prepared from
the homologous strain instead of St-Ag. This extra precipitin
corresponded presumably to group-specific O-antigens not included in
St-Ag. In sera from patients, these group-specific antibodies were
always accompanied by antibodies against antigens common to all
strains of Ps. aeruginosa.

111 patients with cystic fibrosis have been tested for antibiotic
sensitivity and half of the isolates have been phage typed. All the
patients were followed in one clinic and the policy of antibiotic
treatment was consistent during this period. The results show a
dynamic situation where "epidemic" phage types during recent years
have been gradually replaced by other types and, during the same
period, the prevalence of strains resistant to more than one
antibiotic decreased. Multiresistant strains including strains
resistant to methicillin were infrequent in these patients. From 23
per cent of the patients, the same strains were repeatedly isolated
for more than 1 year despite an apparently successful chemotherapy.
Recently isolated strains were found to produce cellbound as well as
extracellular protein A. Ninety-one per cent of the strains produced
extracellular lipase and only 8 per cent were resistant to mercury
chloride. Eighty-one per cent of the patients produced precipitating
antibodies against S. aureus as judged by crossed
immunoelectrophoresis. The investigated properties of S. aureus were
not significantly correlated with the occurrence of precipitating
antibodies against these bacteria. The possible significance of
protein A in the pathology of the respiratory tract infection is
discussed.

Texto: During recent years, more and more data have been accumulated
implicating early malnutrition in subsequent small stature and
behavioral abnormalities.  These studies can be divided into two
large categories: one dealing with cellular and biochemical changes
at a tissue level and one dealing with functional changes within the
nervous system as measured by changes in various modes of behavior.
This chapter will attempt to review the studies in both of these
broad categories, which have led to the present concept that
malnutrition during the growing period will permanently retard
growth, resulting in a stunted individual, and markedly retard
psychologic development, resulting in an individual with permanently
altered behaviors.  We shall first consider the normal cellular and
biochemical development of the central nervous system; second, we
shall examine how malnutrition alters these cellular and biochemical
processes; and finally, we shall review the evidence that implicates
early malnutrition with alterations in later behavior and ability to
learn.

until 8 years, after which there was a progressive decline in growth
rate compared to normal. A complete dietary supplement consisting of
a beef serum hydrolysate, a glucose polymer, and medium-chain

Texto: Duke Medical Center and the National Institutes of Health have
analyzed the maximum achieved heights and weights of 60 persons with
CF over 20 years old.  Both parameters were markedly skewed toward
the lower percentile bands.  No significant differences were found
among patients whose condition was diagnosed early in life, in those
with more severe pulmonary or gastrointestinal impairment, or among
those in whom pancreatic enzyme and/or nutritional supplementation
had been employed.  Nutritional supplementation has yet to be proven
a significant long-term influence on the morbidity or mortality of
CF. - Lober reported data on 60 persons with cystic fibrosis (CF)
over 20 years of age, while our population of 63 individuals
contained only three who were over 15 years old.  The median age of
death in patients with CF is 12 years.  It is not realistic to
compare patients who have survived to adulthood with a younger
group.  He did not state the type of nutritional supplementation
that was of no significance among his patients.  Our experience with
nutritional supplements other than the amino acid-glucose polymer
mixture has been equally poor.  Our data on growth rates were
similar to those of Lober in that both heights and weights were
skewed toward the lower end, and height was less affected than
weight.  Increased rates of linear growth were observed in eight of
13 children under 12 years of age at the time the dietary supplement
was begun.  Patients who continue to take the nutritional supplement
have not shown further deterioration in pulmonary status.

frequently includes Aspergillus, and 30% of their serum samples have
been observed to contain precipitating antibody to this fungus. Serum

and allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis was studied, using a
quantitative assay for antibody to A fumigatus. Although CF patients
had significantly higher levels of Aspergillus antibody, some
antibody was found in all serum samples from normal individuals.
Binding was immunologically specific for A fumigatus. Serum IgE
levels and dermal reactivity to Aspergillus were similar in both CF

patients probably reflect pulmonary colonization, which only rarely
causes infection or sensitization.

22 patients with acute leukemia and 12 patients with cystic fibrosis
during an 18 month interval at the Clinical Center of the National

hemagglutinating (HA) antibody response to immunization. In
comparison to the patients with cystic fibrosis, the patients with
leukemia had a smaller HA antibody response, which lasted a shorter
period of time, and also}i experienced greater toxicity from the

decreased side reactions among the patients with leukemia without
significantly inhibiting antibody production. Previous antineoplastic
chemotherapy had little influence on antibody response in patients

dysfunction of the endocrine glands.  The abnormalities, seemingly
unrelated, appear as loss of electrolytes through the sweat and
salivary glands and as unusually thick, sticky mucus secretions that

abnormalities of exocrine secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis
(CF) suggest the possibility of a disturbed functioning of the plasma
membrane in this disease. Several lines of evidence indicate that
fibroblasts express the presence of the CF genotype. Therefore these
cells were used in an in vitro study directed at determining whether
the manifestations of CF might be related to an alteration of one or
more of the protein components of the plasma membrane. In order to
evaluate the synthesis of these components, growing fibrosblasts from
patients with CF and normal subjects were briefly exposed to either
14C- or 3-H-leucine. Their plasma membranes were then isolated and
subjected to analysis in a nondetergent acrylamide gel system.
Coelectrophoresis of differentially labeled preparations revealed the

Texto: Pulmonary function in children with cystic fibrosis was assessed by
the arterial-alveolar PN2 difference adjusted to sublingual
temperature. The resulting values were compared with the alveolar-
arterial PO2 difference, arterial PCO2, and standard measurements of
lung volume, flow, and diffusing capacity. The arterial-alveolar PN2
difference was nearly one half of the PO2 difference, both early in
the disease and at a more advanced stage. Analysis taking into
account the O2 dissociation curve and the possibility that alveolar
temperature is higher than sublingual temperature suggested that all
of the PO2 difference could be explained in terms of ventilation-
perfusion imbalance in gas-filled units of the lung. Reduction of
fractional CO uptake with increasing PN2 difference suggested that
the decrease in diffusing capacity in cystic fibrosis may be
explained by ventilation-perfusion inequality. A significant
relationship between arterial PCO2 and the PN2 difference supported
the view that ventilation-perfusion inequality is the cause of CO2
retention when present. The PN2 and PO2 differences were abnormal
before the standard tests of lung volume and flow, but in general,
the correlation was excellent. Because the PN2 difference was not
superior to the PO2 difference in detecting early disease, and
because the technical problems in its measurement are considerable,
it is not recommended as a routine measurement.

Texto: The results of open thoractomy and pleurectomy or pleural abrasion
for 17 episodes of pneumothorax in patients with cystic fibrosis were
compared with the results of observation, closed thoracostomy, and
closed thoracostomy with sclerosing agents. Open thoracotomy had the
advantage of insuring prompt resolution of the pneumothorax. A small
incision minimized postoperative morbidity. The average hospital stay
was 15 days after open thoracotomy and 19 days after closed
thoracostomy, with or without sclerosing agents. Complications of all
treatments were infrequent. A limited symptomatic recurrence was
observed in 2 of 17 pneumothoraces successfully treated with open
thoracotomy. Recurrence also occurred in 1 of 8 treated with
observation, 3 of 9 treated with closed thoracostomy, and 1 of 14
treated with closed thoracostomy and sclerosing agents. A loss of
vital capacity was usually noted 4 to 18 months after resolution,
regardless of treatment. Forty per cent of patients in both operative
and nonoperative groups survived 3 years. In our experience, open
thoracotomy can be used safely for treatment of unresolved or
recurrent pneumothorax and warrants further evaluation as a primary
therapy for pneumothorax in patients with cystic fibrosis.

Texto: Normal children as well as those with asthma and cystic fibrosis were
studied to assess the contribution of lung zones emptying at
different rates to the curvilinearity of the maximal expiratory flow-
volume curve. Lung volumes, maximal expiratory flow-volume curves
breathing air and then breathing a helium-oxygen mixture, and single-
breath nitrogen washouts were measured. Forced expiratory maneuvers
from lung volumes near functional residual capacity were performed to
produce transients of flow exceeding maximal flow defined by the full
flow-volume curve. Normal children and those with asthma and mild
cystic fibrosis had small or no transients. Those with severe cystic
fibrosis had large transients as well as increased phase I on the
nitrogen washout curves. These large transients were associated with
increased curvilinearity of the maximal expiratory flow-volume curve
and smaller than normal flow response breathing helium. In severe
cystic fibrosis, the large transients suggest sequential emptying of
fast and slow spaces, which influences the shape of the maximal
expiratory flow-volume curve. The fast space could be due to
compression of an enlarged anatomic dead space. Any time constant
inequality between parenchymal units present in asthma and mild
cystic fibrosis does not appear to contribute significantly to the
shape of the maximal expiratory flow-volume curve.

Texto: Tracheal mucous velocity was measured by observing the motion of
teflon discs across the tracheal mucosa through a fiberoptic
bronchoscope. The average rate of movement in 14 adult patients with
cystic fibrosis was 2.6 mm per min plus or minus 3.3 SD, compared
with 20.1 mm per min plus or minus 6.3 in 20 normal subjects of the
same age (P less than 0.001). This failure of mucociliary transport
may play a role in the pathogenesis of the pulmonary disease in
cystic fibrosis. Administration of a beta-adrenergic agent,
terbutaline, increased the average mucous velocity in the patients
with cystic fibrosis (to 5.5 mm per min plus or minus 3.6 SD, P less
than 0.001) but not in control subjects. This observation has
potential therapeutic significance.

Texto: Mucociliary clearance data obtained by our group in relatively
healthy cystic fibrosis subjects was not affected by cough.  The
majority of subjects mentioned in the original article did not cough
during the study and indeed were chosen because they were relatively
healthy at the time.  It was possible to study them over fairly long
periods without interference from cough and thus the relatively
normal clearance times demonstrated were presumably due to
mucociliary transport.  Reference was made to nasal mucociliary
clearance studies in patients with cystic fibrosis and normal
subjects which indicated that clearance was similar in both groups
until mild inflammation of the nasal mucosa was produced.  We would
like to point out that the work was performed in our Laboratory,
since no reference was given in the discussion.

Texto: The large number of congenital metabolic disorders makes a complete
discussion of the biochemical problems, hazards, pharmacologic
implications, and anesthetic recommendations for each impossible.
This review is confined to discussion of certain aspects of several
genetically acquired diseases of metabolism which the
anaesthesiologist may be called upon to manage in the pediatric
patient.  Every genetic metabolic disease is the result of a specific
enzyme defect (or defects) in function or in amount.  In this review,
diseases in which defects are known (e.g., homocystinuria), suspected
(e.g., myotonia congenita), and unknown (e.g., cystic fibrosis) are
discussed.  Therapeutic approaches to genetic metabolic disease
include: supplying the missing product; preventing substrate
accumulation; preventing alternate product synthesis; enzyme
induction; enzyme replacement; increasing deficient function with
cofactor administration; and compensatory therapy.  Obviously, the
ideal way to treat the consequences of a genetic disease is to
normalize the patient biochemically.  For diseases where the
pathophysiology is clear, this goal is approachable; for conditions
where the pathophysiology is unknown, only compensatory therapy is
possible.

Texto: Young adults with cystic fibrosis have lower blood pressures than
control subjects of similar age and sex. The low blood pressure may
be related to the excessive loss of salt in the sweat of these
patients. A beneficial effect of the cystic fibrosis gene may be
protection against developing hypertension in both the homozygous and
heterozygous states, especially if the heterozygote has borderline
elevation of sweat electrolytes.

aeruginosa bacteria still cause troublesome infections in patients
with a variety of illnesses: extensive thermal injury, leukopenia
from antineoplastic chemotherapy and other forms of immunosuppressive
treatment, chronic pulmonary disease such as cystic fibrosis, or
intravenous narcotic use. The use of antibiotics has improved the
prognosis of pseudomonas infections considerably. However, patients
with marginal or defective host immunity may need more extensive
therapy to master the infection. By evaluating additional modalities
of treatment such as granulocyte replacement, improved usage of
antibiotics, and active (prophylaxis) or passive antibody
administration, the optimal combination may be found.

Texto: A phenomenon associated with the genetic disease of cystic fibrosis
(CF) is the presence of a serum factor that stops or discoordinates
ciliary beating.  This effect has been demonstrated by exposing
freshwater mussel or oyster gill cilia, or rabbit tracheal cilia, to
sera from homozygous or heterozygous cystic fibrosis subjects.  Assay
reproducibility is unsatisfactory, however, and the mechanism of the
effect is not understood.  Nor do we know why there may be
considerable differences between the activity of tested heterozygotes
and of homozygotes.  Because the ciliary assay is capricious, there
is a need to understand how ciliary beating is disturbed or stopped.
Since microtubules are important in the mechanism of ciliary motion,
they could conceivably show alterations during the response to
inhibitory substances.  There has been no ultrastructural study,
however, of the effects of ciliary inhibition on the axonemal
components.  Therefore, this study was designed to examine ciliary
structure during the different stages of ciliary inhibition.  Rapid
microtubular disappearance and reappearance occurs in the terminal
cilia of the freshwater mussel Unio when exposure to CF serum causes
a shock-stop reaction, and return to water allows resumption of
normal ciliary beating.  In contrast, a slow-stop reaction causes
distortion of cilia, asynchronous beating, and ejection of cells from
the distal gill filament, but ciliary axonemal structure is
preserved.  Slow-stopped cilia do not resume their beating in water.
Saliva from reserpine-treated rats causes ciliary inhibition similar
to that induced by CF serum.

Texto: Primary peritonitis, rarely diagnosed preoperatively, is an uncommon
disease accounting for 2.1% of all pediatric abdominal emergencies.
It is often associated with urinary or hepatic pathology, the former
the source of the infecting organism in the majority of cases, and
presents with characteristic symptoms depending upon whether it
occurs in infancy or childhood. The symptoms and signs which allow
for a positive prospective diagnosis are illustrated by comparing
this disease to those entities with which it is most often confused,
e.g. diffuse peritonitis of other etiologies, and include a short
duration of symptoms, associated urinary tract infection and an
absence of free air on abdominal roentgenograms. In the past, gram
positive organisms were the most common infecting agent; however, in
this series gram negative bacteria accounted for 69% or the
organisms. Antibiotics with a gram negative spectrum and exploratory
laparotomy with appendectomy are the hallmarks of therapy, the latter
replaced by abdominal tap only in the patient who satisfies the
criteria for primary peritonitis and in whom an associated disease
makes the risk of surgery prohibitive.

Texto: The recent proliferation of genetic knowledge has been accompanied by
speculation about its uses in the pursuit of both medical and social
goals, as well as by fear and concern about possible misuses.  These
speculations have appeared in the proceedings of numerous symposia
and in many books and papers.  A review of this literature reveals
that the nonmedical participants in this debate were preoccupied with
those aims of genetics that might benefit (or threaten) society,
while the physicians were concerned with the accomplishment of
standard medical missions in which social aims figure only
incidentally.  These missions are diagnosis, management, and
prevention of disease.  The specific uses of genetic knowledge most
frequently mentioned were advances in the taxonomy of disease that
lead to improvements in diagnosis and treatment of individual
patients and their relatives, genetic counseling, and genetic
screening.  The latter two, particularly screening, are preventive
and represent the interface between medical genetics, especially
population genetics, and society.  This review focuses on
developments in genetic screening, defined as the search in a
population, generally for medical reasons, for individuals possessing
particular genotypes.

Texto: Previous reports have indicated that cystic fibrosis (CF) patients
with pancreatic enzyme insufficiency have a raised faecal bile acid
output.  In this study, 18 out of 29 CF patients and 2 out of the 4
non-CF patients with pancreatic enzyme insufficiency had raised
faecal bile acid levels.  In the CF patients no correlation was
found between faecal bile acid and faecal fat excretion, but an
inverse relation was shown between faecal bile acid values and age.
Those CF patients with overt liver disease tended to have the lowest
faecal bile acid values.  Duodenal spiration in 5 CF patients and in
one non-CF patient with pancreatic enzyme insufficiency
(Shwachman-Diamond syndrome), produced very small fluid volumes.
Duodenal fluid mean total bile acid concentrations were within
normal limits.  Estimation of serum bile acids in these 6 patients
showed that 3 patients had raised serum bile acid values.  It is
suggested that excessive faecal bile acid loss may produce a
contraction of the bile acid pool, and lead eventually to a
reduction of intraduodenal bile acid concentrations.  Measures which
curtail faecal bile acid loss may have a particular significance in
the management of CF.

Texto: It has always seemed to me that the use of the Exercise Lability
Index (ELI) distorts results and may be misleading because a falsely
high value for lability is obtained when the PEF at rest is low.  It
is incorrect to compare percentage values from such patients with
percentage values from those with figures at rest which are near to
normal.  The Jones Liability Index avoids this distortion.  I do not
suggest that a proportion of CF patients do not have abnormal
lability but would maintain that the ELI introduces inaccuracy which
may blur the distinction between CF and other respiratory conditions
and may lead to the postulation of problems concerning lability in
CF which do not necessarily exist.  Failure to use a bronchodilator
agent to reinforce brief exercise may also cause distortion but in
the opposite direction.

been given regular parenteral soya oil emulsion from near birth.

Recordnum: 00208
Texto: We have read with interest the report by Elliott and Robinson
concerning the apparent beneficial effects of intravenous fat
infusions in a child with cystic fibrosis.  We question whether the
increase in essential fatty acids brought about by soya oil can
account for the favourable course of the disease in this patient.
Our own observations confirm that essential fatty acids levels are
often below normal in cystic fibrosis, but they do not correlate
with the clinical condition of the patient.  It seems unlikely that
minor degrees of essential fatty acid deficiency would impair
prostaglandin synthesis, or give rise to the usual clinical features
of cystic fibrosis. - Our own more recent research in platelet
aggregation, prostaglandin, and cyclic nucleotide production, makes
us aware that simple EFA deficiency per se cannot be the origin of
the symptoms of CF.  The possibility that some other agent in the
infusion mixture (which, for example, contains about 12% tocopherol)
may be a contributing factor, is also under investigation.  This
does not, however, invalidate a possible therapeutic effect of EFA
in the disease, and in particular, a partial correlation of a
possible disorder of prostaglandin synthesis.

Texto: Early insulin response to rapid intravenous injection of glucose was
studied in 7 cases of cystic fibrosis aged 8 months to 9 1/2 years.
Plasma insulin was measured with a radioimmunological method. Blood
glucose values were determined and the glucose disappearance rate
(kG) calculated. In all children except the youngest one the early
insulin response values were low compared with normal children. The
kG-values were normal and correlated neither to the duration of
clinical symptoms, nor to the patients' actual clinical condition
measured by means of the Shwachman score. The explanation of the
decreased insulin response is probably the progressive fibrosis of
the pancreas. This may also explain the reported increased incidence
of diabetes mellitus in cystic fibrosis. Comparison is made with the
condition in pancreatic fibrosis in rabbits, produced through duct
ligation.

prevalence in their relatives. Increased 0ronchial lability, mainly
due to bronchoconstriction, was present in 54% of patients and 27% of
relatives. The results showed that increased prevalence of bronchial
lability, but not atopy, is found in first-degree relatives of CF
children, and that the abnormal lability and atopy found in CF
children does not indicate a familial allergic background.

Texto: Reports of children with cystic fibrosis living well whilst on
intensive treatment can be covered by allegations that their disease
must be basically mild.  More revealing evidence comes from the
longterm survival studies done by Professor Warren Warwick, of the
University of Minnesota.  The introduction of antibiotics have
allowed the children to live loner, but 3/4 were dead by aged 10
years.  Physiotherapy given after infections prolonged lives so that
half were still alive at 10 years - but still faced a relentless
death rate.  Prophylactic - daily - physiotherapy produced a
doubling of survival at 20 years from under 30% to over 60%.  I do
not deny for a moment that daily physiotherapy with inhalations is a
great strain on the family, but it is not as great as the strain of
watching the slow and relentless decline of the child which, with
racking cough and persistent dyspnoea, is anything but peaceful.

Texto: A small polypeptide within the molecular weight range of 6,000 to
11,000 was found in immunoglobulin fractions from sera of cystic
fibrosis homozygotes and heterozygotes.  This factor appears to be
responsible for interfering with ciliary activity in oyster gills.
Since it can be dissociated from IgG without reductive cleavage it
must be bound in a non-covalent manner.  After its dissociation the
IgG fractions from cystic fibrosis sera no longer inhibited ciliary
activity.  This finding explains the differences previously observed
in the molecular weights of the ciliary inhibitor synthesized by
cultured cells and that of sera from cystic fibrosis genotypes.

Texto: We have recently proposed a classification of the disorders of sexual
development based upon the presumed site of action of the abnormal
gene during embryogenesis.  These disorders, which may be either
genetic or nongenetic in nature, are the result of disturbances in
the physiology of sexual differentiation during embryogenesis.  The
purpose of this review is to summarize the current physiologic
concepts of normal sexual differentiation, to review the known
hereditary disorders of sexual development, and to consider briefly
the implications that these mutations have for the understanding of
normal sexual differentiation.  The translation of genetic sex into
phenotypic sex is a complex process.  Since some 19 hereditary,
single-gene determined disorders of sexual development are currently
recognized that involve loci on both the autosomes and the X
chromosome, it can be inferred that at a minimum 19 genes and hence
19 discrete biochemical steps are involved in this process.  At least
10 mutations result in male pseudohermaphroditism, whereas only 2
mutations are known to cause female pseudohermaphroditism.  The
predominance of male type of mutation is the result of the fact that
the formation of the male phenotype is actively induced by the
secretions of the fetal testis whereas the formation of the female
phenotype does not require secretion from the fetal ovary.  The end
result of these mutations that involve the formation and action of
testosterone can be similar, and it requires anatomic,
endocrinologic, and genetic study of individual patients to identify
the mutant genes involved.  Undoubtedly, many more as yet
unidentified genes must participate in sexual differentiation.  The
identification of these genes will depend on the continued
delineation of new simply inherited clinical syndromes.  Any
fundamental understanding of the programming of events in phenotypic
differentiation will require not only the identification of the genes
involved but the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms by which
each of these genes is expressed.

Texto: Professor R. K. Chandra and others suggest that estimation of serum
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) might help in detecting carriers in families
at risk for cystic fibrosis.  Observers in the U.K. have been unable
to confirm these findings, whereas Dr. J. A. Smith of New York
supports them.  Perhaps the crux of the matter lies in the technique
of estimating serum AFP.  if a small number of families is analysed
the proportion of affected individuals may differ from the expected.
By chance some families may have all normal children whereas some
may have all affected children.  For example, nowadays, since
families tend to be small, the appearance of an autosomal recessive
condition is often sporadic with only one affected person in the
family.  This could well apply to cystic fibrosis.

counterimmunoelectrophoresis and radioimmunoassay sera from (a) 37
patients with cystic fibrosis (age 6 months to 17 years), (b) 10 of
their siblings, and (c) 24 of their parents for the presence of
raised serum levels of AFP.  By counterimmunoelectrophoresis we were
unable to detect an increased serum concentration of AFP in any of
the cystic fibrosis patients or their relatives.  In addition, the
results from the radioimmunoassay method showed that all of the
cystic fibrosis patients and their relatives had normal
concentrations of AFP in their serum. - Using a double antibody
radioimmunoassay we found the mean serum AFP for seven children with
cystic fibrosis to be little different from that of controls, while
all seven values fell within the normal range for this series. - In
seven patients considered to have cystic fibrosis on the basis of a
sweat chloride level above 65 mmol/l the mean serum
alpha-fetoprotein (AFP level was 1825 (range 130 - 2360) microg/l.
The corresponding level in the patients was 433 (range 80 - 1055)
microg/l.  Drug therapy given to these patients may have a subtle
hepatoxic influence, thereby causing a rise in AFP levels.  The
severity of the disease does not influence the degree of elevation.
There is a corresponding rise in carcinoembryonic antigen levels
also, but the latter is related to the degree of tissue damage and
results from the sero-cross-reactivity between mucus-producing
respiratory mucosa and fetal tissues.

of feeding infants with an elemental diet.  Considerable interest is
currently being shown in the use of the artificial diet in cystic
fibrosis.  It may be used as a supplement to ordinary food or to
supply all the nutritional needs of the child.  In the latter event
we believe that it is particularly important to emphasize to the
parents the need for an additional source of dietary fat.  Clinical
evidence and animal experiments suggest that infants, because of
their rapid growth rate, are particularly at risk and that in the
absence of dietary E.F.A. they will develop deficiency symptoms in
about two months.

obstructing gas exchange in the alveoli and finer airways of

often not very effective.  The mechanical removal of such materials

benefit in selected patients refractory to conventional therapy
(particularly those with alveolar proteinosis or accidentally
inhaled radioactive particles).  This report describes the
anaesthetic and lavage techniques currently used in managing
patients with alveolar proteinosis and mucoviscidosis and in whom
lung lavage repeated at approximately six-month intervals has
resulted in both subjective and objective improvements.  In 14
lavages in four different patients (10 lavages in two patients with
alveolar proteinosis and four lavages in two patients with
mucoviscidosis) certain physiologic responses to lung lavage,
particularly those related to oxygen transport, were measured
quantitatively in an attempt to evaluate and to optimize anaesthetic
and lavage techniques.  The maintenance anaesthetic during lavage
was selected randomly, so that each patient received light
anaesthesia with ketamine/diazepam during one lavage and light
halothane anaesthesia during lavage of the contralateral lung.

an important advance in detecting cystic fibrosis, improving genetic
counselling and providing early effective treatment. The sweat
chloride test, which is reliable in diagnosis, is technically too
difficult for a screening program, and only reliably detects
homozygotes. In contrast, the meconium test for detecting homozygote
newborns is simple, inexpensive, reasonably specific but its general
application has yet to be evaluated. Detection of serum components is
the basis of two new tests to distinguish patients with cystic
fibrosis and carriers. The effect of these serum components on
ciliary activity is the principle of one test, an extremely difficult
procedure that is subjective and lacks sufficient specificity for
routine use. The second test, in which serum components are separated
by isoelectric focusing, may provide an objective biochemical means
of detecting both homozygotes and heterozygotes.

Intracutaneous tests with A. fumigatus extract gave types 1 and 3

Texto: A qualitative method of detecting elevated meconium protein
concentration was compared with a method of determining meconium
albumin concentration by electroimmunoassay since elevated meconium
protein levels can indicate pancreatic insufficiency caused by cystic

specimens that gave a false positive reaction with the Boehringer
Mannheim test strip and contained a greater than expected
concentration of albumin.  It was possible to exclude pancreatic
insufficiency in all of these children by determining the ratio,
albumin : alpha1-antitrypsin in meconium and subsequent faecal
specimens, since it was found that values of this ratio in excess of
2.0 suggested pancreatic insufficiency of the type associated with
cystic fibrosis. Three of 14 neonates with subsequently proven cystic
fibrosis yielded meconium specimens giving negative test strip
results and low albumin concentrations. In two of these patients, the
ratio, albumin : alpha1-antitrypsin in the meconium was within normal
limits but, within two months of birth, the albumin : alpha1-
antitrypsin ratio in the faeces of both children was greater than 3.0
suggesting that pancreatic insufficiency had developed.

individuals whose cultures showed CFFA has histories of allergies.
The association of CFFA in the culture medium derived from
individuals having allergies with the intermittent presence of this
activity suggested that environmental factors induced a CFF-like
activity in such white blood cell cultures. The oyster ciliary assay,
using medium from white blood cell cultures, cannot be used for
screening for the CF heterozygote since the substitution of culture
medium for serum did not eliminate inconsistent results and CFFA was
not specific by this assay for the CF gene. Of the fibroblast lines
established from the four persons whose initial white blood cell
cultures consistently showed CFFA, only one (No. 7) showed the CF
culture phenotype (CFFA positive and metachromasia).

Texto: Family studies have been done to determine if the phenotypes
described for the cystic fibrosis (CF) cultured cell reliably
detected the CF gene. Two culture phenotypes were studied in culture
derived from consecutive generations in four CF families: (1) cystic
fibrosis factor (CFF) in the medium of short-term white blood cell
cultures assayed by a modified oyster ciliary test and (2) the three
characteristics of cultured skin fibroblasts (metachromasia without
alcianophilia at 0.3 M MgCl2, CFF in the culture medium and metabolic
cooperation with normal fibroblasts). As CF is an autosomal recessive
disorder, the family offered a test unit for determining the
specificity of these cell phenotypes for the CF gene. On the basis of
detecting the CF culture phenotypes in the homozygote and obligatory
heterozygotes, the parents, and their segregation in consecutive
generations, detection of the CF gene was not possible in the white
blood cell cultures, but was possible in the skin fibroblast
cultures.

These range all the way from disorders of the neonate that are
closely related to parturition, to acute infectious diseases seen in
infancy and early childhood, to chronic disorders such as cystic

Texto: From 1971 to 1973, we hospitalized 41 symptomatic patients with
cystic fibrosis for intensive pulmonary therapy.  The more severely
ill patients were admitted more than once during this period.  Our
study included 100 courses of such intensive treatment.  Garamycin
pediatric injectable, containing 10 mg/ml of the active ingredient,
was administered intravenously to all patients in divided doses of
3.0 to 5.0 mg/kg/day.  The purpose of the study was to evaluate the
tolerance, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of garamycin when
administered parenterally to cystic fibrosis patients with serious
infections.  During the 100 courses of treatment, clinical
improvement was rated as follows: significant or definite
improvement, 39; moderate improvement, 50; slight improvement, 9; and
no change, 2.  The use of garamycin pediatric injectable is safe and
can be helpful in the management of the pulmonary infectious
complications of cystic fibrosis when employed along with other
well-established modalities of therapy.

Texto: It is most important to deal with the feelings of the child and his
family in regard to cystic fibrosis.  Genuine recognition of feelings
by the pediatric staff can go a long way toward reassuring family
members that their long-standing burden and suffering are being
validated and understood.  When a family manifests early signs of
difficulty in coping with the emotional and physical stress imposed
by cystic fibrosis, it is helpful to refer them to a child
psychiatrist for consultation.  It is primarily the families at high
risk for breakdown which most require early prevention and
intervention.  The role of the pediatrician as the primary clinician
is crucial.  It is he who must provide the support and understanding
that are integral parts of the primary prevention of emotional
decompensation in this disorder.

defined as "hypertrophy of the right ventricle resulting from
diseases affecting the function and/or the structure of the lung,
except when these pulmonary alterations are the result of diseases
that primarily affect the left side of the heart or of congenital
heart disease."  Cor pulmonale has been extensively studied and
reported in adults, but it has received relatively little attention
in the pediatric age group.  Although some parts of knowledge gained
from adult studies can be used, chronic cor pulmonale in children and
infants is quite a different entity from that usually seen in adults.
This review is primarily an attempt to clarify some of the confusion
surrounding this subject and to focus on the pediatric aspects.
Pathophysiology, etiology, diagnosis, and treatment are discussed.

fibrosis and correlated to class of skin fibroblast metachromasia.
Seven patients belonged to class I (vesticular metachromasia), 16 to
class II (generalized metachromasia), and 12 to class III (no
metachromasia).  Class I patients had significantly lower vital
capacity (VC) than class II patients.  As regards the other lung
function tests, no general trends were found in class I patients
compared with the other two classes.  For class III patients the lung
function tests reflected more serious lung changes than those of
class II patients; statistically significant differences were found
as regards residual volume/total lung capacity, one-second forced
expiratory volume (FEV1), and FEV1/VC.  The differences were not due
to varying intensity of treatment.  The results are in accordance
with the findings in a previous study of the clinical and
radiological lung symptoms and serum protein values in CF when

Texto: Metachromasia of cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with cystic
fibrosis (CF), and the assignment of the fibroblasts to one of
three classes after the morphological distribution of the
metachromatic staining, have been described by Danes and Bearn
(1968, 1969) and Danes (1969).  In two previous studies from this
hospital (Lykkegaard  Jacobsen 1975, Lykkegaard and Thuesen Pedersen
1975) the clinical, radiological, and functional severity of the
lung disease and the serum protein pattern in CF patients were
studied in relation to classes of skin fibroblast metachromasia.  It
was found that class III patients tended to be more severely
affected than class II patients, and more than class I + II
patients, and, possibly, class I patients were also more severely
affected than class II patients.  Sproul and Huang (1964), in a
study of growth patterns in cystic fibrosis, found a significant
correlation between severity of the respiratory disease and height
and weight retardation.  In the present study, height and weight
development in 98 CF patients are correlated with class of skin
fibroblast metachromasia.

Texto: A retrospective study of clinical and radiological lung symptoms and
intensity of treatment of 98 patients with cystic fibrosis was
conducted.  The results were correlated to class of skin fibroblast
metachromasia.  Fourteen patients belonged to class I (vesicular
metachromasia), 52 to class II (generalized metachromasia), and 32 to
class III (no metachromasia).  All patients above 16 years of age
(six patients) were class II.  Simple scoring systems for clinical
lung symptoms and for treatment of lung disease were developed.  When
compared at the same ages, class I and III patients were more
severely affected (judged by the clinical lung symptoms) than class
II patients, and they had been more intensively treated.  Comparing
class I + II patients (metachromatic fibroblasts) with class III
patients (ametachromatic fibroblasts), it was found that class III
patients were more severely affected and had been more intensively
treated than class I + II patients.  As regards chest radiographs
(judged by Norman's system) a similar pattern was seen, but no
statistically significant differences were found.  In 68 patients (9
of class I, 35 of class II, and 24 of class III) the serum protein
electrophoretic fractions were studied.  It was found that class III
patients had more severe alterations than class II patients, and more
than class I + II patients.  The proportion of female patients in
class III was greater than in the other two classes, but this could
not explain the differences.  Because of the small number of patients
in class I, the differences between class I and class II patients are
more doubtful than the differences between class III and class II
patients, or between class III and class I + II patients.

Texto: Sera from juvenile diabetic and nondiabetic controls were tested,
using the immunoperoxidase method, for the presence of islet-binding
immunoglobulins. All diabetic sera tested contained an islet-binding
protein and on the average the sera were more positive than age-
matched controls. Normal adult sera are undifferentiated from
juvenile diabetic sera. Most sera from children less than two years
of age did not bind to islet tissue and sera from cystic fibrosis
patients had a markedly diminished ability to bind to islet tissue.
The binding protein appears to be an immunoglobulin which selectively
reacts with elements of the islet beta cell.

Texto: The esterolytic activity of mixed and parotid saliva in cystic
fibrosis (CF) patients and normal subjects was determined using BAEE
(alpha-Benzoyl-1-arginine-ethylester) as the substrate. Using soybean-
trypsin-inhibitor the trypsin-like activity (TLA) was measured and
plotted as a function of parotid flow rate. In addition calcium,
protein and pH were determined. Trypsin-like activity in mixed and
parotid saliva showed large individual variations in CF and normal
children. In parotid saliva we could not find any significant
difference, whereas a reduction of TLA in mixed saliva of CF patients
was observed. The fact that our normal values fell within the range
of heterozygotes reported by Rao et al. (19), makes their hypothesis
of a close relationship between reduced TLA and the genetic defect
very doubtful. Protein, calcium and pH increased with augmented
salivation and no difference between CF patients and normal age
matched children could be found except for the pH at a flow rate
above 0.75 ml/min per m2 body surface where significantly lower pH
values resulted. The relevance of reduced TLA to the pathogenesis of
cystic fibrosis is discussed.

results in a palmar parathenar pattern, has been reported to be

the presence of this pattern in 313 patients with congenital heart
defects (including 86 with isolated VSD), 176 with cystic fibrosis
(CF) or relatives of those with CF, and 333 with no known clinical
disease who were unrelated to individuals with CF. The frequencies in
these three groups were 1.6, 2.3, and 0.6%, respectively. None of
those with isolated VSD defect had a DPAT. All five individuals in
the heart defect group with a DPAT had pulmonic stenosis. Of the
total of eleven individuals in our series with DPAT patterns, eight
were affected only on the right hand. The frequency of DPAT in
individuals with no known disease in this series was 4/406=1.0%, more
than double the frequency in a control series, published previously
by DAVID, 5/1,129=0.4%. If the 73 relatives of those with CF are
excluded from our own 'control' group, the frequency of DPAT in this
group is then 0.6%, closer to the results in DAVID's control series.

paranasal sinuses, consisting of opacification of the maxillary
sinuses either alone or as part of a parasinusitis.  Symptoms of
sinusitis seldom occurred and treatment was not generally required.
Agenesis or delayed development of frontal sinuses was also seen in
the majority of patients.  Nasal polyps occurred in 27% of the
patients, all of whom were over five years of age.  Excluding those
patients under five years of age, none of whom had polyps, the
incidence was 36%.  In general, polyps were not observed in those
patients with severe disease.  Mild degrees of conductive hearing
loss were noted in the younger age groups especially, but no
instance of severe hearing loss or nerve conduction disturbance was
encountered.  Such mild degrees of hearing loss may merely reflect
the application of standards too stringent for this age group.
Throat and nose cultures on 26 patients revealed pseudomonas

retention test (Fig. 1) has now been in use for 10 years for the
detection of depleted iron stores in subjects with iron deficiency
(Heinrich et al., 1966; Heinrich and Bartels, 1967).  Further
studies were necessary to investigate the clinical reliability of
increased 59Fe2 absorption in patients with erythroblastic
hyperplasia, which may control the regulation of iron absorption by
iron stores.  The relationship between iron absorption and iron
stores was studied in pancreatic insufficiency to reinvestigate the
effect of pancreatic secretion on iron absorption.  Iron absorption
in patients with gluten-sensitive enteropathy was investigated in
order to correlate the impairment of iron absorption with the degree
of villous atrophy and to study its recovery on a gluten-free diet.
Dietary iron absorption was measured in patients with gastric
mucosal atrophy and partial gastrectomy to investigate the extent to
which iron malabsorption is responsible for the high incidence of
iron deficiency in such patients.  The combination of the diagnostic
59Fe2 absorption test and measurement of the whole body 59Fe2
elimination rate is a useful routine procedure for the detection and
quantification of gastrointestinal or urogenital blood loss as a
cause of iron deficiency.

Texto: The levels of gentamicin in blood and in secretions of the
tracheobronchial tree were measured in 14 children (8 with cystic
fibrosis and 6 with tracheostomy) in a cross over fashion after the
administration of 40 mg of gentamicin by aerosol or by endotracheal
injection. High levels of gentamicin (greater than 20 mug/ml) within
the bronchial secretions were observed in 7 children after
aerosolization and in 11 children after endotracheal instillation.
Corresponding blood levels were low (less than 3 mug/ml) in all
patients and no detectable levels were found in 10 children after
aerosolization and in 6 children after endotracheal instillation. No
significant differences were observed between children with cystic
fibrosis and those with tracheostomy. Since intramuscular injection
of gentamicin (a single dose of 1.5 mg/kg) resulted in low levels of
gentamicin within the bronchial secretions (less than 2 mug/ml in 10
patients, among whom 4 had undetectable levels); it is concluded that
the administration of an antibiotic such as gentamicin, directly to
the trachea by endotracheal injection or by aerosolization might
prove to be helpful when the infection is confined mainly to the
tracheo-bronchial tree.

Texto: In certain cases of obscure chronic lung disease, the possibility of
a genetic disorder, such as cystic fibrosis of the pancreas, should
be considered. When the genetic defect fails to cause pancreatic
involvement, the partial expression of cystic fibrosis is
encountered. Elevation of sweat electrolyte levels is not sufficient
to confirm the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in adults since normal
levels vary widely in both adolescents and adults. Other tests
should, therefore, be utilized. The cilia dyskinesis test is positive
in both homozygous and heterozygous patients with cystic fibrosis.
Utilization of this technique in a family study confirmed the
diagnosis of partial expression of cystic fibrosis in an adolescent

and after administration of cholestyramine.  The absorption of
cephalexin was improved in coeliac disease diverticulosis and cystic

delayed.  The absorption of both trimethoprim and sulphamethoxazole
was increased in all three conditions.  However there was a
disproportionate increase in the plasma level of trimethoprim in
coeliac disease and diverticulosis when compared with that of
sulphamethoxazole.  In Crohn's disease there was a threefold
increase in the peak plasma level of sulphamethoxazole.  After
cholestyramine administration there was malabsorption of all three

from the sputum of a child suffering from cystic fibrosis, by
reduction of the fibrillar mucus, chromatography on ECTEOLA-

obtained have a wide heterogeneity with regard to acidity and
molecular size. The neutral chains contain blood group H active
oligosaccharides and incomplete chains as short as 1 residue of 2-
acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose. The minimal size of the neuraminic
acid-containing chains is less than that of the sulfated chains,
which increases with the degree of sulfation. The sulfate groups are
linked at C-6 at the D-galactose residues.

Texto: This paper describes the Data Registry System of the Cystic Fibrosis
Foundation.  Through this system an annual up-dated and corrected
data base has been prepared for cystic fibrosis patients seen at
U.S.A. Centers from 1966 through 1972.  From the data base, a large
number of life table studies are calculated.  A study is specified
by its data base, the observation period, analysis age (age year or
year since diagnosis), the Centers included, and the condition of
patients at birth, and possible additional factors such as sex, age
at diagnosis, or race.  The annual rates of mortality are measured
by a force of mortality technique.  Two techniques have been used to
appraise the mortality of particular groups, graphing the cumulative
survival function for the group together with the cumulative
survival function for a comparative group, and calculation of
mortality ratios of actual to expected deaths (by an applicable
standard mortality table).  This latter approach lends itself
readily to tests of significance.  For the purpose of calculating
mortality ratios, two standard tables have been prepared on the
basis of the 1972 Data Base and the 1966-1972 observations.  The
first of these standard tables is for use with age year studies, and
the second is for years since diagnosis studies.  The paper comments
on the number of mortality studies by calendar year, by sex, by
condition at birth, by age at diagnosis, and of survival from
diagnosis of patients diagnosed in 1966-1972.  The calendar year
studies indicate an improvement trend in the survival experience
from 1966 to 1972 but a change may be occurring.  The study by sex
exhibits a higher female mortality.  The 7% of patients who have
meconium ileus at birth show a significantly higher first-year
mortality, and a somewhat lower survival rate thereafter even if the
first year of life experience is excluded.  Mortality data for
groups specified by age at diagnosis are given.  For patients
diagnosed during 1966-1972, there is some indication of better
survival than for patients diagnosed prior to 1966.  The
continuation of these mortality studies on an annual basis should
further our understanding of survival patterns for cystic fibrosis
patients.

Texto: The urinary excretion of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP)
and guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic GMP) was examined in 98
normal children and 46 children with cystic fibrosis between the ages
of 9 months and 18 yr. Diurnal variations in cyclic AMP and cyclic
GMP excretion were observed in subjects from either group, and peak
levels of cyclic nucleotide excretion were generally observed during
the period of 0700 to 2100 h. Excretion rates (mumol/day) of cyclic
AMP and cyclic GMP increased significantly with age. When cyclic AMP
and cyclic GMP excretion rates were normalized for urinary creatine,
or body weight, the values declined significantly with age in both
groups of patients. Cyclic GMP excretion normalized for body surface
area also decreased with age, while the value for cyclic AMP (2.86
plus or minus 0.08 mumol/day/m2, mean plus or minus SE) was constant
with age in both normals and cystic fibrosis children. With some
comparisons of age groups there were significant differences in
cyclic nucleotide excretion between normal subjects and children with
cystic fibrosis. The differences noted were dependent upon the
methods used to normalize excretion rates (urinary creatine, body
weight, surface area, and the ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP
excreted). In general patients with cystic fibrosis excreted greater
amounts of cyclic GMP than did normals. The most striking comparison
was the ratio of cyclic AMP to cyclic GMP excreted which was 9.09
plus or minus 0.50 in all normal children and 4.41 plus or minus 0.32
in children with cystic fibrosis (P smaller than 0.001).

Texto: Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (173) from 144 patients with cystic
fibrosis (CF) of the pancreas in seven hospitals were serotyped with
the agglutination systems of Homma (1974) and Fisher et al. (1969).
The two systems were complementary. Strains from CF patients were
much less likely to furnish a stable type on repetitive typing tests
than strains from other patients. This was related to the frequent
occurrence of mucoid P. aeruginosa strains. The 173 strains were
divided among 11 Homma serotypes. A single Homma type (type 8)
capable of mucoid growth comprised 104 (60%) CF strains. Eight
serotypes were detected in 77 strains from 48 CF patients in one
hospital; three strains were detected in one hospital CF unit; and
two strains were detected in each of five hospital CF units. The CF
serotype comprised from 50 to 93% of CF strains in the seven
hospitals. These P. aeruginosa strains dissociated in vivo as judged
by mucoid and nonmucoid colonies on primary culture plates and
continued to dissociate during subcultures. Both colony type were the
same serotype. The tendency to regard colonial phenotypes (mucoid,
nonmucoid, rough) as separate strains was erroneous. Repetitive
typing with the two systems gave better results than a single system.
The mucoid P. aeruginosa strain is probably spread from patient to
patient, rather than acquiring its mucoid characteristic de novo in
the CF patient. It is not known why the mucoid CF strain has a
peculiar predilection for CF patients, nor why it generally loses the
quality in culture but retains it indefinitely in the patient.

Texto: We have used ion-specific electrodes in an attempt to map the sodium
and chloride activities on the skin under differing surface
conditions. The range of values and the standard deviations are so
wide that a baseline for the untreated dry skin is precluded. In
patients with cystic fibrosis, a wide range of values is also found.
For this group, measurements on dry skin taken immediately after
washing were in the same low range as for healthy subjects. The range
of measurements on the dry skin of newborn infants was similar for
full-term infants with reactive sweat glands and for premature
infants who failed to show sweating responsiveness to natural reflex
stimulation as well as local glandular stimulation with sudorific
drugs. For only two conditions have measurements of sodium and
chloride activities on the surface of the skin been of value: (1) on
the sweat-covered skin for the detection of the high values
encountered in cystic fibrosis, and (2) on the dry skin surface,
deprived of autonomic innervation (spinal paraplegia), extremely low
sodium and chloride activities reflect absent gland activity.

Texto: An alpha-feto-protein (AFP) is present in many mammals, in birds, and
in sharks during development. The AFP present in different species
have similar physicochemical properties and often have common
antigenic determinants. Their study, both in health and disease, has
provided a useful model for the understanding of other phase-specific
antigens and the activation of the genes which control their
synthesis. In the human fetus, the level of AFP falls with increasing
maturity. The more sensitive methods of detection have disclosed that
this fetal protein persists in trace amounts throughout life and its
level increases in maternal blood during pregnancy. The principal
sites of synthesis are the fetal liver and in some mammals, the yolk
sac splanchnopleur. In humans as well as in mice and cows, it is
notable that the synthesis of AFP is increased in liver cancer cells
and that high levels of this protein are present in serum. Elevated
values of AFP have also been detected in human subjects with
undifferentiated tumours of the testis and ovary. A fall to normal
levels has been noted in cases of complete remission after surgery
and a return to high levels in patients who develop metastases. In
some patients with hepatitis a temporary rise in the level of AFP has
also been observed. In recent years, the detection of high levels of
AFP in amniotic fluid has proved to be of great value for the
prenatal diagnosis of neural-tube defects. Abnormal levels have also
been found in the amniotic fluid or in maternal serum in cases of
spontaneous abortion. Such measurements are now being assessed as a
method of monitoring abnormal pregnancy.

Kulczycki rating of the severity of their disease.  Of the seven
children who had determinations of sweat electrolytes at the time of
taste testing, three failed to excrete sufficient amounts for
measurements.  Patients with cystic fibrosis, as a group, were not
found to have more sensitive taste acuity than normal.  This
corroborates the findings of Wotman and associates and strongly
suggests that a general abnormality of the taste system is not
routinely symptomatic of cystic fibrosis.  Henkin and Powell
hypothesized that extremely acute taste is related to elevations in
the concentration of electrolytes in sweat.  This seems unlikely
since the patients given sweat tests in the present study all had the
high levels of sodium and chloride characteristic of cystic fibrosis,
yet all had taste sensitivities in the normal range.  Wotman and
associates suggested that perhaps the severity of the disease
accounts for the appearance of hypersensitivity in the chemoreceptive
systems.  The clinical ratings of the severity of the disease did not
correlate with taste sensitivity.

Texto: Studies on an infection with gram-negative bacteria in Limulus led to
the discovery of the extreme sensitivity of the amebocytes to a
gram-negative endotoxin.  This led to the development of a method for
measuring very small amounts of endotoxin in biologic fluids and in
human blood.  Yet, had the original observation of Cantacuzene on the
large common edible spider crab been followed, this remarkable
sensitivity of marine arthropod blood to endotoxin would have been
recognized much earlier.  The original work of Metchnikoff on sea
star larvae stimulated him to develop the major theory of
phagocytosis but, until the adult animal of the same genus was
re-examined half a century later, the presence of a powerful
substance which selectively inhibits growth of lymphocytes following
primary immunization remained unknown.  Though mucus secretion is a
fundamental characteristic of most invertebrate phyla and all
vertebrates, little is known about the regulatory mechanism of the
secretory process; studies of the responses of specialized
invertebrate secretory cells to infection have now led to a new means
of studying macromolecular control of mucus secretion in man.  These
three stories emphasize the continuing need to study disease as a
biologic phenomenon.

Texto: In this study, we have compared two groups of children with cystic
fibrosis.  One group of CF children had severe malnutrition in the
first year of life, whereas the second group of CF children had not
been malnourished.  The catch-up growth experienced by both the
control and malnourished groups was impressive and was generally
complete in terms of height and weight for age.  This finding is
consistent with other reports regarding catch-up growth following
malnutrition associated with celiac disease, anorexia nervosa, renal
acidosis, Cushing syndrome, and hypothyroidism.  Though the
malnourished group tended to have lower IQ and school performance
scores, the differences were not statistically significant except for
backward digit span.  That difference may indicate an organic
impairment due to malnutrition or to any of several other factors.
Our data fail to demonstrate any permanent or devastating effect of
early malnutrition during a very rapid growth phase on the subsequent
growth, IQ, and school performance in children with cystic fibrosis
studied at age 7 to 10 years.

Texto: I have measured the fatty-acid profile of C.F. erythrocyte membranes
in view of the fact that some variations in membrane activity have
been observed with this system.  The results show that there was a
lowered content of linoleate (18:2) and arachidonate (20:4) in C.F.
erythrocyte membranes, and the total essential-fatty-acid content
was significantly lower than either control group.  There was no
significant difference in the concentrations of the other major
fatty acids (palmitate, stearate, and oleate) and we could not
observe any striking alteration in the concentration of any of the
minor fatty-acid components of the membrane.  It would thus appear
that the overall fatty-acid pattern in C.F. erythrocyte membranes is
altered only by a diminution in those fatty acids which are of
dietary origin.  The fact that there was considerable overlap
between the C.F. and control data makes it rather unlikely that the
fatty-acid profile closely reflects the biochemical lesion of the
disease.  When the essential-fatty-acid levels of the C.F. samples
were compared with the Schwachman clinical scores of the patients,
there was a surprisingly poor correlation (r = 0.49) which was not
statistically significant.  The correlation with the nutritional
part of the clinical score was equally low.  Diminished
essential-fatty-acid content is often observed in many acute
illnesses.  In addition, the possibility exists that C.F. patients
may be particularly susceptible to essential-fatty-acid depletion
due to their pancreatic dysfunction.  Further research on fatty-acid
transport and metabolism in C.F. is clearly needed to establish the
role of essential fatty acids in the disease.

Texto: Lieberman reported that there was considerable overlap in
quantitative C3 levels between all of the C.F. subjects tested, and
the control group.  His control group, however, was composed of
subjects with bronchiectasis or chronic bronchitis, in whom C.F. had
been ruled out.  The use of a more proper control group by
Lieberman, either in place of or in parallel with his "diseased"
control groups, would have provided a more meaningful interpretation
concerning the role of complement in cystic fibrosis.  We agree that
there is a tendency for C3 to be higher in C.F. females than in C.F.
males.  Although Lieberman was quick to dispel any notion of C3a
being implicated in the aetiology of C.F., he overlooked the one
facet of our initial study that still makes our hypothesis feasible
- raised C3 levels in C.F. obligate heterozygotes.  Hann et al.
reported that serum-C5 was raised in both C.F. patients and their
parents.  Our initial data on C5 levels by radial immunodiffusion
and haemolytic studies do not confirm this finding.  We are
supporting the hypothesis that C.F. is either a complement-caused or
complement-mediated disorder, in which a C3a-like molecule (C3a,
bradykinin) either alone or by complexing with IgG gives rise to the
physiological and pathological state of C.F.

Hellsing and Kollberg used a single radial immunodiffusion method
not radioimmunoassay.  Prosser et al. demonstrated quite clearly
that similar results were obtained in cystic-fibrosis (C.F.)
screening with test-strips and with more elaborate methods of
albumin detection in meconium.  Using both radial immunodiffusion as
well as test-strips, Kollberg's group noticed a decreased albumin
content in C.F. meconium stored at room temperature and mailed for
several days.  Diminished albumin concentration might have been
brought about by remaining proteolytic activity.  Prosser et al.
found no change in albumin content during refrigerator storage.
Approximately 10% of C.F. cases have no raised albumin content in
meconium and this problem has not yet been solved.

Texto: Mr Stuart and Dr Burdon speculate on the possibility that the high
frequency of the cystic-fibrosis gene among Caucasians may be due to
the heterozygotes having some advantage in biological fitness over
normal homozygotes.  They suggest that this might be due to
increased resistance to typhus, once endemic in Europe, on the basis
of the well-known immunological cross-reactivity between the
causative organism, Rickettsia prowazeki, and certain strains of the
species Proteus vulgaris, which is agglutinated by sera from
cystic-fibrosis patients and heterozygotes.  However, there is no
evidence that this agglutination is an immunological reaction.  It
appears microscopically to be associated with disorganisation and
inhibition of the bacterial flagellae leading to clumping of the
organisms.  As such it is probably analogous to the effect on cilia
of rabbit trachea and oyster or mussel gills.  The cilia factor,
although associated with IgG, is now known not to be IgG itself and
may well be the C3a component of complement.  These and other
observations, such as those on salivary and sweat gland secretions
and on sodium flux, suggest that all these phenomena are membrane
rather than immunological effects.  Although it is possible that a
Proteus flagella antigen could also be the binding site for the
cilia factor, this seems improbable.  An alternative hypothesis is
that heterozygotes for the cystic-fibrosis gene have increased
resistance to tuberculosis.  This would meet the requirement of a
common disease recently endemic in Europe at least as well as
typhus, and is suggested by indirect evidence from a family study
demonstrating a significantly lower incidence of tuberculosis among
the parents of cystic-fibrosis patients than among parents of
controls.

unknown.  We therefore undertook to study fatty-acid oxidation
(Beta-oxidation) in patients with C.F.  There was no significant
difference in the results obtained in controls and either affected
individuals or heterozygous carriers.  All the values in the
affected individuals lay within the normal range.  Unless for some
special reason the defect is not expressed in leukocytes, these
results indicate that the metabolic pathway involved in fatty-acid
oxidation (Beta-oxidation) is intact in C.F.  It therefore seems
unlikely that the reported deficiency of certain essential fatty
acids in C.F. is the result of a defect in fatty-acid metabolism.

race, and we also found a wide range of values within any given

C3 levels in the majority of our C.F. patients when the values were
compared with projected group mean values for the appropriate age,
and we did not find a significant elevation of the mean C3 level for
the C.F. patients in any of the age-groups tested.

Texto: 6 patients with proven cystic fibrosis and a wide variety of
Schwachman clinical scores were studied and the controls were 10
healthy children undergoing minor elective surgical procedures.  The
results show that for children with cystic fibrosis there are not
only decreased proportions of essential fatty acids but that 20:3
omega-9 is found in all cases.  Our results suggest that there is no
intrinsic defect of the desaturating system in cystic fibrosis and
that the pattern of essential-fatty-acid deficiency is entirely
similar to that found in dietary deficiency of essential fatty
acids.  A further significant finding is the occurance if 20:3
omega-9 in apparently healthy children, particularly the very young.
This is probably diet-related and emphasises the young child's very
large requirement for essential fatty acids for membrane synthesis.
The need for adequate polyunsaturated fatty acids in childhood
cannot be overstated, whether they be for normal membrane synthesis
or lowering of serum-lipids, giving possible protection against
cardiovascular disease.

Texto: In three literature reports the linoleic acid (L.A.) levels for
cystic fibrosis (C.F.) compared to controls are always more
significantly lower than arachidonic acid (A.A.).  Similarly the
percentage lowering is also more for L.A. than A.A.  There is, thus,
no "overwhelming" evidence for a blocked or absent desaturase and
the cause of the E.F.A. deficiency must be elsewhere.  We have found
up to 2.5% of the total fatty acids in both serum and red cells to
be C20:3-omega-9.  All of our C.F. patients have shown this acid at
some stage and, for most, it is a permanent feature of their fatty
acid profile.  It has been reported that C20:3-omega-9 would
probably act as an inhibitor of prostaglandin formation from A.A.
and it is interesting to conjecture on whether this could account
for some of the symptoms of C.F.  C20:3-omega-9 would also be
incorporated into P.I. and could then alter membrane properties.

plasma-lipids, we compared the fatty-acid composition of the
serum-lecithin of 23 patients with malabsorption from a variety of
different causes and found similar changes irrespective of the
underlying cause of the malabsorption.  The only exception to this
was that classical E.F.A. deficiency was found only in patients
whose malabsorption was due to massive small-bowel resection.  All
other causes of malabsorption gave rise to changes identical to
those found by other workers in C.F.; there is thus no reason to
postulate an additional metabolic abnormality specific to C.F.  The
relatively normal amounts of arachidonic acid reported in some
E.F.A. deficient patients may not be entirely due to arachidonic
acid.

Texto: Mr Rivers and Mr Hassam propose that the subnormal levels of
linoleic acid (18:2) found in the plasma-phospholipids of patients
with cystic fibrosis are due to malabsorption.  To substantiate
their hypothesis they deduce that the remarkable remission observed
in a cystic-fibrosis patient given intravenous 'Intralipid' was due
not to the 18:2 content of the 20% triglyceride component of the fat
emulsion but to the 20:4 content of its 1.2% phospholipid component
(not 6% as they state).  This explanation seems unlikely in view of
the relatively small proportion of 20:4 in intralipid phospholipid,
especially since intravenous administration of intralipid
phospholipid to healthy subjects decreases both the 18:2 and 20:4
content of their plasma-phospholipids.  Comparison of the effects of
complete intralipid versus intralipid phospholipid on the level of
20:4 in the plasma-phospholipids of patients with cystic fibrosis
would soon determine whether they lack the ability to desaturate
18:2 to 20:4.

fibrosis based on levels of stool trypsin and chymotrypsin on the
fourth day of life.  One interesting observation is the number of
premature babies who have little or no pancreatic trypsin or
chymotrypsin at this time.  For example, of the babies tested from
St. Helen's Maternity Hospital between June, 1974, and April, 1975,
84 were classified as premature in the birth-records book.  Samples
were received for only 65 of these babies.  Of these 65 babies, 26

only 2.5% of the other babies tested during this period.  As may be
expected, the lower-birth-weight babies tend to have lower
stool-enzyme concentrations.  We feel that our data indicate that at
least some premature babies would benefit from pancreatic-enzyme
supplementation or predigested foods in the first few days after
birth.

when immersed in water.  Almost without exception, the children with
cystic fibrosis had noticeable wrinkling of the fingers within 2 min
of immersion in hand-hot water, whereas normal children showed no (or
minimal) wrinkling after 10 min.  This wrinkling is due to an excess
of salt in the skin, which increases water-binding capacity of
keratin.  The test would thus appear to provide a simple and cheap
screening method for cystic fibrosis, but one that may not be

iodides for the treatment of pulmonary disease, organic iodine

disease. Medications containing iodide may induce hypothroidism in
euthyroid patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, 131I or surgically
treated Graves' disease, or following hemithyroidectomy for nodules;
and they may induce hyperthyroidism in patients with endemic iodine-
deficient goiter, autonomous nodules or nontoxic nodular goiter, or
in patients recently treated with antithyroid drugs for Graves'

patients with completely normal thyroid function during

hypothyroidism in patients with cystic fibrosis remains obscure.
Iodide-induced myxedema may also occur in patients receiving drugs
which alter thyroid function, such as lithium, phenazone, and
sulfisoxazole. Finally, iodides do have a role in the treatment of
hyperthyroidism but their use should probably be restricted to

Texto: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a generalized disorder of the exocrine glands
inherited as a recessive genetic trait.  The disease was more fully
described as a specific entity in 1939 with a pathology of dilated
ducts and fibrotic changes in the pancreas and copious secretory
intraluminal obstruction of the bronchial tree.  The symptoms
predominately involve the gastrointestinal tract as more frequent,
bulky, malformed and malodorous stools and the respiratory system as
cough, wheezing and signs of chronic respiratory obstruction.  In
certain instances, only one of these two systems will have manifest
symptoms and signs.  An increased concentration of sodium and
chloride in the sweat was discovered in 1953.  The elevated salt
concentration of the sweat has proven to be a reliable diagnostic
tool to confirm the presence of the disease.  Few diseases present in
so many different forms, degrees of severity and at different ages as
does CF.  All present treatments for cystic fibrosis are essentially
symptomatic.  Since the study of families having a child with cystic
fibrosis has shown an incidence of the disease in one fourth of their
siblings, classification of the disease as an autosomal recessive
genetic disorder suggests that the concept of an abnormal gene
related to alteration in a single enzyme should apply.  The diagnosis
of cystic fibrosis in childhood is an overwhelming even to the

History plays a vital part in the diagnosis of gastro-intestinal

disease of the pancreas which results in maldigestion and loss of

congenital steatorrhea, pancreatic infantilism, and pancreatic
fibrosis.  The concern of the pediatrician in the late 1930's and
early 1940's was to distinguish nonfatal celiac disease from fatal
cystic fibrosis.  In 1954, Shwachman presented clinical and
laboratory features that distinguish these two entities.  Today one
is not justified in making a diagnosis of celiac disease without a
confirmatory small intestinal biopsy coupled with a normal sweat

polyacrylamide gels to analyze microliter quantities of whole serum

of proteins called proteins B, C, and D (Fig, 1). A pH 5-10 gradient
is used (Fig. 2) and each sample is screened using a serum volume
which contains 300 g immunoglobulin G (IgG). Individuals homozygous

individuals on the basis of the presence of a C/F factor protein band
(Table 1). Heterozygous carriers for C/F are distinguished from C/F
homozygotes 75 percent of the time, on the basis of a deletion in
either band B, C, or D (Table 2). On the basis of screening 65

were similar for both activities, suggesting that the arginine
esterase activity and proteolytic activity represent similar
catalytic entities. These findings are consistent with our hypothesis
that the basic defect in cystic fibrosis may reside in the deficiency
of a proteolytic enzyme which results in the accumulation of the
various cationic macromolecular "factors" described by other
investigators in serum of patients with cystic fibrosis. The
demonstration of a deficiency of proteolytic activity as assayed by
the hydrolysis of protamine, a cationic polypeptide, could explain
the presence of ciliotoxic cationic protein or polypeptide factors in
serum of patients with cystic fibrosis and may, in some unknown
manner, be related to the clinical manifestations of the disease.

Texto: The ability of epsilon-amino caproic acid (EACA)-treated normal serum
and of cystic fibrosis (CF)-affected and carrier sera to promote the
release of lysosomal enzymes from sensitized human polymorphonuclear
leukocytes (PMN) was assessed through the measurement of beta-
glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase activity after exposure of these
cells to the various test sera. This study was initiated to extend
the analogies between preciliary dyskinesia factor (pre-CDF),
separated from the cell-free media of cultures derived from CF
homozygous and heterozygous individuals, and C3a anaphylatoxin. The
extent of lysosomal degranulation of human PMN exposed to fresh
untreated sera of each of five controls, seven CF homozygotes, and
eight heterozygotes, as expressed by the amount of beta-glucuronidase
releases, was 7.84% (+/- 0.934) for control sera, 14.01% (+/- 1.79)
for CF-affected sera, and 10.61% (+/- 1.43) for heterozygous sera.
The difference between CF homozygotes and control subjects is
significant (P less than 0.0001), as is the difference between CF-
affected and carrier individuals (0.001 less than P less than 0.005)
and between control subjects and carriers (0.001 less than P less
than 0.005), when beta-glucuronidase. However, the differences
between control subjects and CF heterozygous individuals are not
significant. Treatment of these sera with 1 M EACA gave values for
beta-glucuronidase and myeloperoxidase release which are slightly
reduced when compared with those obtained with fresh, untreated
samples. EACA apparently reduces the activity of beta-glucuronidase
released from PMN. Amicon filtration studies of these serum samples
demonstrated that degranulating ability and the presence of cilicary
dyskinesia, as assessed by rabbit tracheal bioassay, are not always
associated. Therefore, the relationship between pre-CDF and the
degranulator activity in native CF-affected and carrier sera is
unclear, in part because of the limitations inherent in the test
systems employed.

Texto: Serum glutathione reductase (NADPH-GSSG oxidoreductase, EC. 1.6.4.2
(GR)) has been examined in cystic fibrosis subjects (CF), obligate CF
heterozygotes, and control subjects. Serum protein concentration was
similar in the three groups. Regardless of the units used to express
activity (milligrams of protein or milliliters of serum) or whether or
not samples were dialyzed against water or phosphate buffer, mean
serum GR in CF was greater than in control subjects (P less than or
equal to 0.002) in all series over several years. Under the above
assay conditions no difference in serum GR between control subjects
and carriers was detected. Calculated and assayed values of combined
control and CF sera agreed as did expected and observed 50% activity
in 1:2 sera dilutions in CF, control subjects, and carriers. Addition
of FAD to incubation media did not effect enzyme activity in the
three groups. Differences between CF and control subjects persisted
after dialysis in membranes permitting passage of molecules of
approximately 12,000 mol wt or less. These findings would tend to
exclude the effect of extraneous serum factors in explaining the
differences between CF and control subjects. The percentage of
initial GR activity after four days storage (0-4 degrees) was
significantly greater in CF than in control subjects (P less than
0.025). The effect of heparin on serum GR was recorded as the
percentage of activity after incubation with heparin vs. activity in
the standard assay for individual subjects. The effect of incubation
with 5 mug/ml heparin on serum GR activity was greater in control
subjects than in carriers (P less than 0.0005) and CF (P less than
0.0005). Mean serum GR activity in CF and carriers was unaffected by
heparin, whereas mean activity in control subjects was decreased. In
no control was the percentage of initial activity with heparin
greater than the mean of CF and carrier groups. Only 3 of 20 CF and 4
of 20 carrier individuals had percentages lower than the control
mean. The CF and carrier distributions were clearly different from
the control distribution. Serum GR was determined in seven non-CF
individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).
Activity in the COPD was different from CF and no different from
control subjects. In none of these controls or COPD was serum GR as
great as the CF mean. Serum GR in no CF was as low as the mean of
control subjects or COPD. It is concluded that serum GR activity is
greater in CF than in control subjects, carriers, and non-CF COPD
subjects; that the difference in activity is not attributable to an
extraneous serum factor, that the activity difference is not
secondary to chronic respiratory disease; that in comparison with
control subjects, GR from CF serum behaves differently after storage;
and that serum GR from CF and carriers behaves differently from
control GR in the presence of heparin.

Texto: The nauplii of the brine shrimp Artemia salina are dependent upon the
function of their salt gland to maintain osmotic pressure within
narrow limits. A number of drugs interfere with this function and are
lethal to the nauplii. Saliva and serum from normal persons, patients
with cystic fibrosis, and obligate heterozygotes were tested for
lethal effect against brine shrimp nauplii. At salt concentrations
between 100 mM and 2.5 no difference was found among the phenotypes.
At lower concentrations a difference was noted occasionally between
some normal subjects and some individuals carrying one or two genes
for cystic fibrosis. Data from an independent series of experiments
indicate that the naupliar deaths result from distorted ratios of
Na+/K+ and not from a specific gene product. No difference was noted
in the O2 uptake of nauplii treated with saliva or serum obtained
from normal subjects, patients with cystic fibrosis, or obligate
heterozygotes.

Texto: There are several reports of secretory and other abnormalities
present in cultured fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis
(CF). We have, therefore, investigated aspects of complex saccharide
synthesis and secretion by such cells compared with fibroblasts
derived from heterozygous (HZ) parents and from normal (N) children.
The main glycosaminoglycans produced by skin fibroblasts  during in
vitro culture were hyaluronic acid, heparan sulfates, and dermatan
sulfate-like materials. Using double-label experiments with D-[3H]-
or [14c]glucosamine and analyzing the products by ion exchange
chromatography, it was shown for five CF, two HZ, and four N lines
that these polysaccharides were secreted into the medium in
approximately similar proportions to each other. Moreover,
experiments in which three CF, nine HZ, and three N lines were grown
in log phase for up to 5 days in the presence of [35S]sulfate and
[3H]glucosamine indicate that, during such a period, CF fibroblasts
do not secrete complex carbohydrates at rates significantly different
from N or HZ cells. Neither do such cells shown an abnormal
intracellular accumulation of complex carbohydrates. The latter
observation was further confirmed by preparing whole cell
autoradiographs during growth of six CF, two HZ, and three N lines in
the presence of D-[3H]glucosamine and, subsequently, after addition
of unlabeled medium.

Texto: Polyamine concentrations have been measured in blood samples from a
series of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and control subjects.
Analyses were made by a fluorometric method, in which the amines were
reacted with dansyl chloride and separated by thin layer
chromatography on Kieselguhr. There was no significant difference
between the polyamine concentrations of blood samples from CF
patients and control subjects. Also, the spermidine-spermine ratio
was similar in both groups. Polyamines were also analyzed in exocrine
fluids, and although none could be detected in either CF or control
sweat or saliva, significant amounts of spermine and spermidine were
present in all samples of bile and duodenal fluids. It thus seems
likely that the biliary route is a significant pathway in the human
for excretion of polyamines. The observation that polyamines are
excreted in considerable concentrations via the bile in children may
be of interest in view of the reports of elevated urinary polyamine
concentrations in neoplastic states. Since measurable amounts of
spermine and spermidine were detected in all six bile preparations
available for this study, analysis of these substances in bile may be
of benefit in particular cases.

Texto: Ten adolescent and young adults with cystic fibrosis (CF) have had
well-documented recurrent attacks of acute pancreatitis. The
diagnosis of CF in each patient was delayed because they did not have
pancreatic insufficiency. The diagnosis of CF was documented by the
typical pulmonary involvement and elevated sweat sodium and chloride
levels in all cases and a positive family history in six of the ten
patients. Two patients were diagnosed as having acute pancreatitis
before the diagnosis of CF was made, thus indicating that acute
pancreatitis may be the presenting complaint in the young adult with
CF. The diagnosis of acute pancreatitis was based on the presence of
severe abdominal pain, usually with vomiting, tenderness in the mid-
epigastrium, elevated serum and urinary amylase and serum lipase.
Attacks were precipitated by fatty meals, alcohol ingestion;
postcholecystectomy and tetracycline administration. In some patients
no precipitating event could be elicited. Intravenous secretin-
pancreozymin stimulation tests revealed a diminished bicarbonate
secretion with little effect on the secretion of the zymogen enzymes.
A mild attack of pancreatitis occurred after secretin-pancreozymin
stimulation. The endocrine pancreatic function tested in four
patients was normal as revealed by the glucose tolerance tests and
determinations of serum insulin, growth hormone and free fatty acid.
Transduodenal pancreatograms were performed in three patients; one
showed a normal pancreatic duct, one showed duct obstruction and in
the third patient a beady type of narrowing was found. The
selenomethionine Se 75 uptake of the pancreas was noted only in the
head of the pancreas. This suggests that loss of function occurs
initially to a greater extent in the tail and body of the pancreas.
Three patients died and showed characteristic lesions of CF.

Texto: There has been a recent trend to treating more and more pediatric
patients with chronic diseases on an ambulatory basis.  This is true
of both hemophilia and cystic fibrosis.  Despite their success in
keeping slightly more than two thirds of their patients out of the
hospital, I think that they might be more successful in the future if
the following points are considered.  First, many of those initially
selected for intravenous medications due to their nonresponsiveness
to oral therapy and again later considered failures of intravenous
treatment might actually be noncompliers.  My second point concerns
the lack of follow-up within the patient's home.  It would seem to me
that this would be an ideal place for a public health nurse to check
on the patient's condition, ensure that the procedure was being
properly followed under actual field conditions, and that the correct
amount of medicine has been utilized. - Dr. David's letter regarding
potential problems of noncompliance and home follow-up in the use of
outpatient intravenous antibiotics points out the need for this type
of therapy to be instituted only in those centers in which these
facets can be well controlled. Public health nurses are utilized by
some centers to supervise and assist in the home management of cystic
fibrosis with good success.

physical activity, relatively mild pulmonary disease, no evidence of
liver disease and no family history of diabetes mellitus underwent a
series of carbohydrate tolerance tests in comparison with a group of
18 normal male subjects matched for age and body weight. Compared
with the normal group, the patients with cystic fibrosis had
significantly impaired glucose tolerance and significantly lower
serum immunoreactive insulin levels during oral and intravenous
glucose tolerance tests; serum insulin levels were also significantly
lower after intravenous administration of tolbutamide in the patients
with cystic fibrosis, but the reduction in blood glucose
concentration in each group was not significantly different. During
an intravenous insulin test, the decrease in blood glucose
concentration was the same for both groups, in spite of significantly
lower serum insulin levels in the patients with cystic fibrosis .The
percentage fall in plasma free fatty acids was at least as great in
the patients with cystic fibrosis as in normals during the test
procedures; while a significant decrease in plasma alpha-amino
nitrogen after intravenously administered insulin was seen only in
the patients with cystic fibrosis. These studies suggest that the
carbohydrate intolerance of cystic fibrosis is consequent upon an
impaired insulin response to glucose, but that this insulin
deficiency is partly compensated for by increased peripheral tissue
sensitivity to insulin.

Texto: Meconium ileus represents the earliest clinical manifestation of
cystic fibrosis. The differences found in the composition and amount
of protein, mucoprotein, mucopolysaccharides, and reducing sugars in
meconium from newborns with cystic fibrosis might be of significance
relative to the pathogenesis and early diagnosis of this disease. We
studied the enzymatic activity of disaccharidases (lactase, sucrase,
maltase, and palatinase) in meconium of infants with cystic fibrosis
and controls. We found an increase in the specific activity of these
enzymes in the meconium from infants with cystic fibrosis as compared
to the specific activity in meconium from normal infants. The
increase in the activities, expressed as micromols per gram of
protein per minute was: lactase, 100 times higher; sucrase, 18 times;
maltase, 4.8 times, and palatinase, 8.9 times.

Texto: Single oral doses of 6.25 mg/kg of dicloxacillin suspension were
given to ten cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and eight normal subjects.
Peak serum concentrations and areas under the concentration versus
time curves for dicloxacillin were variable and, on average, were 2
1/2 times lower in the CF patients. The time of occurrence of the
peak serum concentration was similar in both groups and the total
urinary recovery of dicloxacillin was normal or increased in the CF
patients, suggesting that the intestinal absorption of the drug was
unaffected by the disease. The low serum concentrations in the CF
patients were caused by unusually high renal clearances of
dicloxacillin which average 282 +/- 135 compared to 95 +/- 28
ml/min/1.73 sq m in the normal subjects. Creatinine clearances were
also elevated in the CF patients by 55% on average, while urea
clearances were normal. The serum protein binding of dicloxacillin
was similar in both groups of subjects. Because the rapid excretion
results in low and variable serum concentrations of the antibiotic,
treatment of CF patients with dicloxacillin may warrant use of
increased or more frequent doses and monitoring of serum antibiotic
levels.

survey of morphologic changes from the original descriptions of CF
and the numerous subsequent reports, and an analysis of 146 cases
autopsied at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Billings Hospital.
Achylia occurs in 85 to 90% of patients.  Approximately 1 of 7
patients with CF presents with meconium ileus.  In 1962 we described
gallbladder abnormalities in 24 of 72 cases of CF (33%).  In
Anderson's original description of CF, hemosiderosis was present in
nearly every liver, and fatty infiltration was a frequent finding.
The respiratory tract is invariably involved in CF.  The heart has
never been considered a primary target organ in CF.  Bodian described
a higher incidence of nephrocalcinosis in CF than in routine
pediatric autopsies (31% compared to 11%).  With the increased
longevity of patients with CF male sterility has become a recognized
complication.  Increased electrolyte concentrations in sweat are the
most diagnostic manifestation of CF, although an occasional patient
has escaped this defect.  Nasal polyps are frequent and often
recurrent problems in patients with CF.  Malabsorption due to
pancreatic exocrine deficiency was originally described as the main
manifestation of CF.  The autopsy diagnosis of CF is usually based on
a combination of lesions rather than on the changes in a single
organ.

function immediately preceding and following bronchial drainage in
twenty-six patients with cystic fibrosis. Highly significant
increases averaging 5.67, 4.13, 13.47, and 6.98 percent occurred in
peak expiratory flow rate, forced vital capacity, expiratory reserve
volume, and inspiratory capacity respectively. Significant increases
in peak expiratory flow rate, forced vital capacity, and inspiratory
capacity were observed in a subgroup of six of the above patients who
had evidence of bronchospasm. The authors conclude that bronchial
drainage will produce significant increases in routine pulmonary
function values. The results suggest that this treatment is most
effective in clearing the larger, more proximal, airways and is of
benefit even in the presence of clinical bronchospasm.

Texto: Psychophysical experiments measured both olfactory sensitivity to 1-
butanol and sodium chloride and taste sensitivity to sodium chloride
in normal children and in children with cystic fibrosis. The
sensitivity of the children with cystic fibrosis fell within the
normal range. These results stand in contrast to those of Henkin and
Powell, who found children with cystic fibrosis to be hypersensitive
to both olfactory and taste stimuli. Apparent hypersensitivity to
taste stimuli could have resulted from the adapting effects of the
relatively high level of sodium in the saliva of children with cystic
fibrosis. If the contaminating effects of saliva are removed,
children with cystic fibrosis yield, on the average, a taste
threshold identical to that of normal children. There appears to be
no simple explanation for why Henkin and Powell found
hypersensitivity to odorants. The present results indicate that, in
fact, children with cystic fibrosis display a slight hyposensitivity
to odorants.

Texto: The search for the basic defect in cystic fibrosis has so far been
singularly disappointing.  There is no doubt that it is a disease
recessively inherited, ie that the parents carry the cystic fibrosis
gene without showing any signs of ill health (heterozygous) but when
transmitted from both of them to an offspring this child manifests
the disease, having acquired the abnormal gene in double dose
(homozygote).  Cystic fibrosis is the most common of the genetically
determined diseases.  Two types of cultured cells, fibroblasts and
white cells from affected individuals and heterozygous carriers for
cystic fibrosis, showed characteristic changes of metachromasia that
seemed to allow for a classification of patients and carriers to be
distributed into separate classes.  Serum from patients with cystic
fibrosis of the pancreas disorganises the movement of cilia of the
isolated rabbit tracheal mucosa.  One of the early and also most
constant observations is the 'viscosity' of secretions of the mucosal
glands in the respiratory tract, in the alimentary apparatus, in the
biliary system and in the pancreas.  A striking increase in the
levels of sodium and chloride, and to a lesser extent of potassium,
is present in the sweat of practically all sufferers of cystic
fibrosis.  However frustrating and tantalising the outcome of
research into the basic defect has been so far, the ultimate answer
is likely to be astonishing in it simplicity.

Texto: Inhalation therapy can be divided into two types, intermittent
aerosol therapy which is used to administer medications over brief
periods and mist tent therapy which is used for prolonged periods of
treatment.  The present state of knowledge of the basic defect of
cystic fibrosis makes it impossible to give hard and fast guide lines
for the use of inhalation therapy.  Much depends on the individual
experience of the physician and the degree of pulmonary involvement
of the individual patient.  Response to bronchodilators can be
assessed relatively easily, assessment of mucolytics and antibiotics
is difficult.  Antibiotics can be useful in helping to clear
infection in those patients with early disease, as judged by clearing
of pathogens from the cough swab or sputum.  In patients with chronic
cough and large volumes if purulent sputum with positive culture from
gram negative bacteria, the cultures never become negative and only
in the occasional patient can definite clinical benefit be claimed.
A few severely ill patients have dramatically improved when this
therapy has been introduced, and the patients are convinced of the
benefit of this treatment.  It is of course impossible in this
disease, with such a varying clinical course, to prove scientifically
that the inhalation therapy was the reason for this improvement.

frequency of the disease.  The explanation of the unlikely high birth

Texto: The manifestations of cystic fibrosis make it a complex disease, in
the management of which the respiratory physician, the
microbiologist, the gastroenterologist and last but not least, the
psychologist, all are or should be involved.  About 1 in 10 babies
with cystic fibrosis are born with acute intestinal obstruction due
to plugging of the small intestine with very sticky meconium.
Diagnosis is made by the test for excess salt in the sweat, and
although possible very soon after birth, it is easier to carry out at
about three weeks of age when the baby sweats more freely.  The great
majority of children, if not treated, tend to suffer progressively
more frequent chest infections or chronic chest infections.  The
reason for the tendency of the lungs of children with cystic fibrosis
to become colonised by harmful bacteria is not known.  Most cystic
fibrosis children absorb carbohydrate normally, but only about 50%
(range 45% to 80%) of the protein and fats they eat.  The only other
major problem for which any active measures may be required is the
occurrence of fibrosis of the liver in about 5% of these children.
Children with cystic fibrosis should be brought up from the beginning

broncho-pulmonary disease is the major problem.  Pneumothorax is
encountered in about 15% of the older patients and some of these
occur bilaterally.  A few patients develop refractory airways
obstruction and then a trial of steroids is justifiable.  Most
patients with cystic fibrosis also require treatment for their
pancreatic insufficiency.  Diabetes mellitus is more common in cystic
fibrosis than in the normal population.  Analysis of sweat is
essential for diagnosis.  The psychological stresses imposed upon

Texto: Cystic Fibrosis (fibrocystic disease of the pancreas) is a common
inherited disease which, to date, still has a fatal outcome.  The
diversity of clinical manifestations and pathological findings has
added further to the mysterious nature of the disease, as have the
tantalizingly conflicting results of biochemical, physical and
experimental studies in many laboratories of the western world.  One
of the most constant clinical observations is the viscosity of the
secretion of the mucosal glands in the respiratory and alimentary
tracts, in the ducts of the biliary system and in the pancreas.  In
approximately 10 to 15 per cent of all patients with cystic fibrosis
of the pancreas the earliest manifestation, meconium ileus, occurs in
the neonatal period.  In the remaining 85 to 90 per cent of affected
infants the symptoms generally become evident within the course of
the first year of life.  The lung symptoms tend to dominate the
clinical picture in the vast majority of untreated patients and will
ultimately decide the outcome.  The lower respiratory tract is not
the only part involved: nasal polyps and the accumulation of viscous
secretions in the paranasal sinuses with subsequent bacterial
infection are not unusual.  Pancreatic deficiency is present in the
vast majority of patients with cystic fibrosis and consists of a
gross reduction or complete absence of exocrine secretion.  Although
some histological damage has been seen in the neonatal period in
infants suffering from meconium ileus, in general the full-blown
picture of extensive cirrhosis, with portal hypertension,
hepatosplenomegaly, and severe and sometimes fatal haemorrhages from
oesophageal varices, is seen in the older child and adolescent.
Screening of the newborn to enable the institution of protective
measures before lung complications arise has been attempted with
various techniques.  Management includes diet and pancreatic enzyme
replacement.  The treatment of pulmonary disease is the most
important aspect of care in patients with cystic fibrosis, and its
prevention is priority number one in the over-all management.  The
outlook for the child born with cystic fibrosis depends to a large
extent upon the avoidance, or delay until adult life, of the two
complications that threaten his existence: cor pulmonale and
cirrhosis of the liver.

Texto: An account is given of screening for the early detection of disease
in Great Britain today.  The organisation of screening programmes
provided nationally for the whole population is described.  These
include programmes for prenatal care, screening of infants,
screening of schoolchildren, and screening of women for carcinoma in
situ of the uterine cervix.  Selective screening programmes for
tuberculosis and for various industrial diseases are mentioned.
Experience in provision of these services on a national scale has
emphasised the importance of evaluating future screening programmes,
before they are implemented, by research studies on their
effectiveness, their possibly harmful side effects, and their cost.
Evidence from research in screening for a number of diseases is very
briefly summarized, and it is concluded that there may be some
development of programmes for the early detection and treatment of
hypertension and of breast cancer, but for other diseases and for
multiphasic screening, evidence so far available is insufficient to
warrant any immediate extension from research towards service.

phase, however, lower cell protein/DNA ratios were observed
consistently in CF cultures. This difference was not present in

concentration after treatment with both preparations was compared in
each individual. No difference after the two treatments was found in
the control sample. A decrease in sweat chloride concentration after
insulin iontophoresis in comparison with the vehicle was observed in
both the CF (P smaller than 0.005) and heterozygote (P smaller than
0.01) samples. These observations suggest an involvement of insulin
in CF and a possible role of insulin in sweat gland function.

Texto: Fatty infiltration of the liver has been identified
roentgenographically in several young children. Awareness of this
possibility will sometimes allow a radiologist to contribute to the
understanding of the patient's metabolic and nutritional state. If a
child's liver is shown to be abnormally radiolucent, cystic fibrosis
should be considered.

Texto: Massive hemoptysis is a potentially fatal complication of long-
standing cystic fibrosis. Lobectomy may prevent a hemorrhagic death
if the hemorrhage source can be identified and if involvement of the
remaining lung tissue is mild. Selective bronchial arteriography was
performed in six patients with cystic fibrosis to localize a lobar
source of bleeding. Arteriographic findings correlated with
bronchoscopic observations. Bronchial arteriography may be helpful
when bronchoscopy cannot be done because of continuous hemorrhage or
because the severity of the lung disease precludes general
anesthesia, but it is not an adequate substitute for bronchoscopy in
most patients.

Texto: The authors studied bronchial reactivity in children with cystic
fibrosis and with deformative bronchitis. The reaction of the bronchi
was studied both by inhalatory and exercise provocation. Inhalatory
tests were monitored by means of a whole body plethysmograph. Free-
range run was used for the exercise test, and the peak expiratory
flow rate was measured. The described technique of inhalatory tests
was accurate, safe, and not tiring for the patient. No distinct
difference in bronchial reaction between the two groups of patients
could be stated. The bronchial reaction to the inhalatory and
exercise tests was stronger in both groups than in normals but not as
strong as in asthmatics. The nature of bronchial hyperreactivity in
those patients is still unknown. The inhalatory test seems to be more
sensitive than the exercise test in detecting that hyperreactivity.

Texto: An incidence of the genetic recessive disease cystic fibrosis
(mucoviscidosis) far in excess of that reported recently from other
countries, has been encountered in the South West African Afrikaner.
This has probably resulted from the immigration of a segment of the
South African Afrikaner population rich in the gene, into South West
Africa, where, for religious reasons and reasons of geographical
isolation, the gene has persisted and, perhaps, increased in
frequency. Malaria, which killed many of the early settlers, might
have selectively spared carriers of the gene, thus enriching its
occurrence in the population. Details of patients, particularly with
regard to the criteria of diagnosis, are given with the relevant
population and birth figures, from which an estimate of the incidence
of the disease and of its carrier rate has been made. Screening of
the newborn for the condition and the compiling of a register of
potential and obligatory carriers are also discussed.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis, sometimes known as mucoviscidosis, is a generalised
disorder of the exocrine glands which affects children, adolescents
and young adults.  No biochemical abnormality may be regarded as the
primary cause, although at various times it has been suggested that
the defect lies in ion transport, in glycoprotein structure or in
membrane permeability.  Cystic fibrosis is inherited as a Mendelian
recessive, and is the commonest of all such genetic diseases in the
Caucasoid populations of Western Europe and North America.  Super
has detected and documented a frequency of the disease among
Caucasoids in South West Africa which is considerably higher than
that found anywhere else in the world.  An investigation of the ways
in which the disease in South West Africa may differ, clinically or
pathologically, from that found elsewhere, is necessary.

Texto: An electrophoretic technique for demonstrating amylase isoenzymes is
described. After separation in an agarose gel containing a linear
polyacrylamide polymer to reduce electroendosmotic flow, the amylase
fractions are visualized by incubation with a commercially available
dye-starch polymer (Phadebas Amylase Test). The technique detects
amylase fractions with activities below 10 U/l. Some characteristic
changes in such diseases as acute and chronic pancreatitis, cystic
fibrosis of the pancreas, macroamylasemia and inherited variants as
well as after maxillofacial surgery are mentioned.
Recordnum: 00345
Texto: The isoamylases in various human tissue homogenates and body fluids
were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. Nothing suggested any
significant production of amylase in the liver. Minute amounts of
amylase belonging to the pancreatic group of isoamylases might be
produced by the glands of the proximal duodenum. The specific group
of isoamylases produced in the female genital tract could not be
demonstrated in serum or urine. The activity of amylase in serum was
derived from two groups of isoenzymes, one group originating from the
salivary glands, the other from the pancreatic gland. The
contribution of each of these two sources to the total serum amylase
was determined from early foetal life to adult age. A very low
activity of the salivary isoamylases was regularly found in serum
from 14-week-old foetuses. The activity increased steadily with age
and reached the normal adult level, about 80 U/l, at the age of 5
years. The pancreatic group of isoamylases in serum developed later;
the majority of children below 3 months had no demonstrable
pancreatic isoamylase activity. The activity rose slowly to reach
adult level, about 80 U/l, at the age of 10 to 15 years. The activity
did not vary with sex, and the diurnal variation of the isoamylase
was negligible. In children with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas the
activity of pancreatic isoamylases in serum was low.

Texto: Sera from 84 patients with cystic fibrosis, 31 patients with other
respiratory diseases and 21 control persons have been investigated
for the occurrence of antibacterial precipitins and autoantibodies.
Preciptins were studied by means of crossed immunoelectrophoresis,
antinuclear factors by an indirect immunofluorescence technique and
rheumatoid factors by the latex fixation slide test. A very
heterogeneous antibacterial immune response was found in patients
with cystic fibrosis, notably as regards Ps. aeruginosa. None of the
other patients or controls had precipitins against this bacterium.
The occurrence of precipitins against St. aureus and D. pneumoniae
were more frequent in cystic fibrosis patients as compared with
controls, but not as compared with other respiratory disease
patients. No significant differences were found as regards
precipitins against H. influenzae or the occurrence of rheumatoid
factors. Antinuclear factors were more frequent in cystic fibrosis
patients than in the other two groups investigated. A pronounced and
heterogeneous humoral immune response against Ps. aeruginosa in
cystic fibrosis patients chronically infected with mucoid strains of
this bacterium was found to be correlated with poor prognosis and the
reason for this is discussed.

Texto: The concentrations of nine plasma proteins were determined by
quantitative immunoelectrophoresis in sputum specimens from 29
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and from 24 patients with severe
asthma and chronic bronchitis. The results suggested that the
population of CF patients could be divided into two groups in spite
of an absence of difference in clinical status between the groups.
Average concentrations of seven plasma proteins in sputum of group I
CF patients were identical with those in sputum of patients with
bronchitis, but the average concentrations of six of these proteins
in sputum from group II CF patients were higher than those in
specimens from the bronchitic patients and were similar to
corresponding concentrations in sputum from patients with asthma, all
of whom were examined while in status asthmaticus. The average
concentrations of 14 secretory proteins were the same in all sputum
specimens whether or not they were produced by patients with cystic
fibrosis, asthma or bronchitis. It was concluded that the
concentrations in the bronchopulmonary secretions of proteins
associated with host defence were not diminished in patients with
cystic fibrosis, and failure to produce adequate concentrations of
proteins with antimicrobial activity was unlikely to be responsible
for the above average susceptibility to chest infection in cystic
fibrosis. It is suggested that there exists a group of CF patients in
whom a pulmonary allergic reaction generates an inflammatory response
as severe as that characterizing status asthmaticus and that this
response could be detrimental.

Texto: The hearts and lungs of 36 patients dying of cystic fibrosis have
been studied to establish the relationship between right ventricular
hypertrophy (RVH), pathological changes in the pulmonary circulation,
and the clinical features. The presence and degree of RVH were
measured by Fulton's technique of weighing the ventricles separately.
Of the subjects who died after the age of 3 years, one in six had no
RVH, although the mean age of this group was not significantly
different from that of the remainder. There was no correlation
between duration of cyanosis, haemoglobin levels, and RVH. Although
not statistically significant, the cases without RVH tended to have
had clubbing of the finger-nails for longer periods before death. The
electrocardiogram was useful in the diagnosis of RVH. Right
ventricular hypertrophy was common in children with lungs of large
volume as judged by the radiographic centile of lung length. Cases
with RVH show reduced background haze in the arteriogram and fewer
arteries per unit area of lung. For the first time thickening of the
medial muscle layer proportional to the degree of RVH has been
demonstrated, only in the smaller arteries. Arterial subintimal
fibrosis is more common in cases with RVH, as is thickening of the
walls of small pulmonary veins. The implications of these findings
are discussed.

Texto: This study was done to determine the role of the Wright peak
flowmeter for evaluation of pulmonary functions in children with
cystic fibrosis.  Peak expiratory flow rate was measured with the
use of a Wright peak flowmeter and one second forced expiratory
volume, maximal mid-expiratory flow rate and maximal voluntary
ventilation were measured with a spirometer in a total of 55
children, 25 of whom had cystic fibrosis disease, with the remainder
being normal.  Measurements were repeated after administration of
bronchodilating drugs to the cystic fibrosis patients.  All the
values of the four measurements were decreased significantly in the
cystic fibrosis patients.  Positive and significant correlation
co-efficients were obtained by comparing the peak flow rate with
other spirometric measurements.  It was concluded that peak
expiratory flow rate is a feasible and useful measurement of
pulmonary functions in cystic fibrosis patients.  No changes were
observed after administration of bronchodilating drugs to these
patients.

Texto: The clinical and morphological findings of 37 cases of cystic
fibrosis of the pancreas from 525 full, but non-consecutive
necropsies are presented.  All of these 37 cases were diagnosed at
post-mortem examination.  The autopsy incidence was 7% and none of
the cases was beyond two years of age.  Morphological findings
revealed varying severities in organ involvement in all cases, with
absence of fibrosis of the pancreas in some.  In only two cases
histopathological changes seemed to be confined to the pancreas.
This study suggests that cystic fibrosis plays a considerable role in
infant deaths in our country and in most if not all cases the
diagnosis must necessarily be based on postmortem studies.

Texto: Although it is generally true that most male patients with cystic
fibrosis are infertile due to congenital atresia or absence of the
vasal structures, this finding is not invariable.  Taussig et al.
reported 2 well-studied patients with cystic fibrosis who had normal
semen analysis, and at this writing both have fathered children.  A
third patient with normal semen analysis also is known to us.  In
addition there are many instances of presumed but undocumented
paternity in these patients.  Cystic fibrosis centers estimate male
fertility at 2 to 3 per cent; although low, this figure warrants
semen analysis before assuming sterility.  In view of this, we feel
that the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis should be considered when the
vasa are absent, but it is incorrect to exclude the diagnosis on the
basis of palpable vasa.

Texto: Infertility and abnormalities of the mesonephric derivatives are
common in patients with cystic fibrosis, but it is not a uniform
finding.  Taussig et al. reported on 2 patients with cystic fibrosis
who had proved fertility.  Abnormalities of the vas could be
documented in pathologic studies, but the vas was found to be present
in some patients who died of cystic fibrosis.  In many patients,
absence could not be ruled out on physical examination.  In healthy,
young children the vas is not easily palpable; even when it is, the
degree of certainty in its identification is less than in the
post-pubertal male.  Cystic fibrosis is a disease with protean
manifestations, and it would be a mistake to rule out cystic fibrosis
just because the vas can be palpated or to have victims of cystic
fibrosis labeled as infertile.

Texto: In 36 children with cystic fibrosis (CF), the isoenzymes of alkaline
phosphatase (AP) were determined microelectrophoretically in
polyacrylamide- and starch-gel.  The study was done to evaluate the
clinical significance of these additional data for the diagnosis of
liver involvement in CF.  The results lead to the following
conclusions.  Serum activity of total AP is comparatively
unsensitive "masking" alterations in the isoenzyme pattern
contributing to the AP serum activity.  In 17 children resp. 47%
bile-duct phosphatase was increased indicating a secretostasis
while other marker enzymes of cholestasis were normal in part.  The
activity of bone phosphatase in the serum showed a significant
correlation to the degree of growth retardation in these patients.
Intestinal phosphatase was present in the serum of only one child
with cirrhosis of the liver being an indicator for liver
insufficiency.  Determination of AP isoenzymes in the serum may
provide additional information about the organs involved for the
physician in handling CF patients.

Texto: Total amylase activity of serum and mixed saliva was studied in
homozygotes and heterozygotes for mucoviscidosis and in healthy
subjects. Mean serum total activity was 269.0 +/- 113.7 U/l in the
homozygotes, exceeding in nearly 50% of the cases the values given in
the literature and those observed in the normal controls. The
difference against the control group was significant (P less than
0.05). Mean serum total amylase activity of heterozygotes agreed with
the mean value for the healthy group (203.5 +/- 79.5 U/l) without a
significant difference. Total amylase activity in the saliva of
homozygotes (148.700 +/- 65.700  U/l) was higher than in the
heterozygotes /118.300 +/- 74.200 U/l) of the healthy children
(51.700 +/- 26.500 U/l). The difference between the homozygous and
healthy groups was strongly significant (P less than 0.01), and that
between the heterozygous group and the combined healthy children and
adult groups was also significant (P less than 0.05). In the
heterozygotes, salivary amylase activity was slightly elevated but
not significantly different from the control group and did not result
in a change in serum total amylase activity.

Texto: We investigated the airway's response to exercise in cystic fibrosis
(CF).  Due to the reported high incidence of allergy in CF we tried
to demonstrate the well documented post-exercise bronchospasm of
asthma in patients with CF.  Subjects ran on a treadmill for 6
minutes at a speed of 3 miles per hour and a gradient of 15 degrees.
For the 12 controls studied, the mean % rise in peak expiratory flow
rate (PEFR) during exercise was 4.7% and the mean % fall in PEFR
during recovery was 0.7%.  For the eight atopic asthmatics studied
the mean % rise in PEFR was 12.2% and the mean % fall in PEFR was
33.7%.  For the 29 patients with CF, the mean % rise in PEFR was
20.3% and the mean % fall in PEFR was 3.1%.  Patients with CF showed
no statistically significant post-exercise constriction compared
with controls, while asthmatic patients showed a post-exercise %
fall in PEFR significantly greater than seen in controls (p < 0.001)
or in CF patients (p < 0.001).  No patient with CF showed
post-exercise bronchospasm, nor was there any difference between
patients with CF who had positive skin tests to common allergens and
those who did not in their pattern of bronchial liability.  It is
suggested that the general desensitization therapy should not be
instituted in patients with CF merely on the basis of positive skin
tests, without more stringent criteria such as characteristic
seasonal variation in respiratory symptomatology, family history of
atopy and positive bronchial inhalation provocation tests.

Texto: Although forty years have passed since the discovery of the clinical
entity called (for lack of a better name) cystic fibrosis, its
treatment remains both symptomatic and controversial.  Moreover, the
efficacy of therapy has been difficult to evaluate for several
reasons: the lack of a suitable animal model for therapeutic
experimentation, the protean manifestations of the disease, the
natural variations in its severity, the prolonged periods of
observation that are required by its very chronicity and frequently
the lack of satisfactory clinical parameters by which to score
response.  Stated in its simplest form, the treatment of cystic
fibrosis is directed towards the long-term control of salt loss,
malabsorption and bronchial obstruction, the management of several
complications of the disease and the establishment of a positive
therapeutic environment that minimizes anxiety and depression.  The
purpose of this review are to help the pediatric practitioner gain
security in his day-to-day management of children with the disease
and to advocate an effective working relationship between the
practitioner and a regional cystic fibrosis or pediatric pulmonary
center for long-term patient management.  Problems in diagnosis,
treatment of salt loss, the prevention and treatment of
malabsorption, the prevention and treatment of bronchial obstruction,
the prevention and treatment of certain complications, and the
psychosocial support of the patient and family are discussed.

Texto: The intrauterine detection of genetic disorders represents one of the
exciting advances in medicine.  The major emphasis in this chapter
will be a detailed review of the newer approaches toward antenatal
detection of congenital malformations and hemoglobinopathies as well
as an overview of the experience and problems of antenatal detection
for chromosomal aberrations and inborn errors of metabolism.
Approaches to prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders include
amniocentesis, visualization of the fetus, and fetal blood sampling.
Prenatal detection of genetic disorders has become a reality.  The
area is evolving so rapidly that the major indications for
intrauterine diagnosis have substantially changed within the past
year.  Prior to this time, maternal age, previous Down's syndrome,
inborn errors of metabolism and X-linked recessive disorders were the
primary criteria, with approximately 85% of the cases being used for
cytogenetic analysis.  Within the past year, in a number of
laboratories, about half of the referrals for amniocentesis have been
for central nervous system defects.  Certainly with the development
of technics for fetal blood sampling, this distribution of the
frequencies of indication may, once again, change substantially.
Most probably for the next few years cytogenetic abnormalities and
neural tube defects will be the most common indications for
amniocentesis.  Amniocentesis will continue to be offered to many
patients with inborn errors of metabolism and probably will be
available for monitoring of hemoglobinopathies and other disorders of
fetal blood as well as for accurate knowledge of the health of the
fetus.

Texto: A 51/2-month-old infant had the single problem of a bulging
fontanelle. A diagnosis of cystic fibrosis with secondary
hypovitaminosis A was made by the findings of high sweat chloride
values and a low serum carotene level. A greatly accelerated rate of
weight gain following the addition of pancreatic enzyme supplements
confirmed the presence of malabsorption. The infant developed
characteristic fibrosis pulmonary disease at 20 months of age. Animal
studies have shown vitamin A deficiency to be associated with
increased cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, diminished absorption
of CSF, and pathological findings of thickening and infiltration with
mucopolysaccharides of the dura mater around the arachnoid villi.

following rupture of subpleural blebs into the pleural space.  Death
can occur, and recurrences have been reported.  Therapeutic
procedures include needle aspiration, closed thoracotomy drainage,
open thoracotomy with pleural scarification, or intrapleural
instillation of irritants.  When injected into the pleural space, the
antimalarial drug quinacrine hydrochloride evokes an inflammatory
response; the resultant fibrosis produces a tight adherence of the
visceral and pleural surfaces.  Quinacrine therapy for pneumothorax
has been frequently used in adults, but there are few pediatric case

conventional roentgenographic methods. Forty-five per cent of the
oral cholecystograms were judged abnormal by our criteria. A study
was considered abnormal if there was no visualization or if there was
visualization of a microgallbladder or structural abnormality
including marginal irregularities, septate gallbladder or
cholelithiasis. Intravenous cholangiography was used to further study
the 22 patients who did not visualize on the oral study. Again,
anatomic abnormalities were prevalent but six patients in this group
had normal appearing gallbladders. Abdominal pain, a frequent symptom
in cystic fibrosis, was not associated with roentgenographic
abnormality. No correlation was seen between the external biliary
tree abnormalities and multifocal biliary cirrhosis which was present
in 40% of these patients. Further, no correlation was seen between
serum gamma glutamyl transpeptidase levels and either of these

Texto: Prior genetic studies of the human pancreatic amylase (Amy2) locus
have been directed principally to the electrophoretic analysis of
serum and urine, on the assumption that these fluids receive
negligible contributions from the salivary (Amy 1) locus. In support
of that assumption was the observation that the isozyme bands were
lacking in patients with cystic fibrosis and in a postpancreatectomy
patient. We have examined the sera of 97 patients having cystic
fibrosis and find normal levels of serum amylase. On electrophoresis,
three-quarters of the cystic fibrosis patients have a pattern (F-
pattern) not observed in normal sera. The pattern is characterized by
the absence of Pa 1. Comparative electrophoresis and mixing
experiments indicate that the F-pattern is of salivary origin and is
unmasked in cystic fibrosis by the absence of a pancreatic
contribution. The normal serum pattern is considered to be an
admixture of salivary and pancreatic amylase. On the assumption that
duodenal fluids might more closely reflect the pancreatic (Amy 2)
locus, electrophoretic studies were performed on 148 normal
individuals and 37 individuals with cystic fibrosis. Electrophoretic
phenotypes in duodenal aspirates are more complex than previously
reported in studies of urine and serum; presumably because of the
higher concentrations of amylase in the aspirates. Comparative
electrophoresis and mixing experiments indicate that the phenotypes
observed in duodenal aspirates also reflect admixture of pancreatic
and salivary amylase. This recognition of pancreatic and salivary
admixture in sera fortunately does not alter our prior understanding
of the genetics of the Amy 2 polymorphism. The extensive studies
which led to the delineation of the Amy 2 polymorphism were
essentially based on the presence or absence of a variant band which
proves now to be outside the zone of admixture.

Texto: Transit time analysis of the forced expiratory vital capacity
maneuver was applied to 37 patients with cystic fibrosis 8 to 22
years of age. This analysis divides the vital capacity into segments
of air and assigns a transit time to each segment. The
characteristics of the distribution of these transit times are used
as measurements of pulmonary function. The quantities were compared
with the forced vital capacity, 1-sec forced expiratory volume, ratio
of 1-sec forced expiratory volume to vital capacity, peak flow,
forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the forced vital
capacity, maximal expiratory flow at 25 per cent of the vital
capacity, specific airway conductance, and arterial PO2 of these
patients. The standard deviation of the transit times was the most
frequently abnormal. The mean transit time had the largest range of
values in terms of its own standard deviation, and it was the best
single estimate of over-all lung function because it correlated
almost equally with large and small airway function. The coefficient
of cariance of transit times was specific in detecting abnormality of
small airways and was as sensitive in the detection of minimal lung
disease as the standard deviation of transit times.

Texto: The incidence of serum IgE antibodies to several species of
aspergillus and the incidence of serum precipitins to these species
and to Candida albicans were determined in 22 children with cystic
fibrosis, 17 children with bronchial asthma, and 18 control subjects.
IgE antibodies were found in 50 per cent of the patients with cystic
fibrosis and in 29 per cent of the patients with bronchial asthma;
none was found in the control subjects. Precipitins to aspergillus
species were present in 59 per cent of the patients with cystic
fibrosis, 35 per cent of the patients with bronchial asthma, and 11
per cent of the control subjects. Greater differences were noted when
the total number of precipitin bands in each group was compared.
There was a trend for the more severe cases of cystic fibrosis (based
on the Shwachman-Kulczycki score) to have a greater incidence of
precipitins and a lower frequency of IgE antibodies to aspergillus
than the milder cases. Candida precipitins were found more frequently
in patients with cystic fibrosis (45 per cent) than in patients with
bronchial asthma (18 per cent); none was found in the control group.
The potential role of fungal hypersensitivity in cystic fibrosis and
the therapeutic implications are discussed in light of these
findings.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis is the most frequent lethal genetic syndrome among
white children and is the cause of much of the chronic progressive
pulmonary disease encountered in children.  Because of the
increasing adolescent and adult population of patients with cystic
fibrosis and their psychosocial, employment, and treatment needs,
this review, whenever possible, will emphasize aspects pertinent to
older patients.  No known biochemical or structural defect will
account for all the pathophysiologic phenomena of cystic fibrosis.
Thus, the definition of the disease rests on the clinical findings;
cystic fibrosis is a syndrome, and not yet a disease.  Incidence
figures for cystic fibrosis are necessarily minimal.  The best
diagnostic efforts currently available fail to detect all those who
die at a young age or who have mild symptoms.  Several pieces of
evidence indicate that cystic fibrosis is transmitted as an autosomal
recessive trait.  An autosomal recessive inheritance for cystic
fibrosis suggests a discrete biochemical or structural defect.  To
date no single lesion has been proved to provide a unifying
hypothesis for the pathophysiology of cystic fibrosis.  Exocrine
gland dysfunction, mucociliary transport, immunology, ciliary
factors and transport mechanisms are discussed.  The manifestations
of cystic fibrosis involve many organ systems and the pattern of
presentation is variable.  Respiratory, gastrointestinal,
genitourinary, and sweat gland manifestations are discussed.  There
are at least 3 possible approaches to screening for cystic fibrosis:
sweat testing, evaluation of pancreatic function, or detection of
some product of the defective gene.  Prenatal diagnosis and
heterozygote testing, diagnosis in adults, and diagnostic problems
are also examined.  Treatment includes prevention, pulmonary therapy,
and gastrointestinal therapy. Pulmonary and other complications and
their treatment are discussed, as well as psychosocial aspects, and
evaluation and prognosis of cystic fibrosis.

Texto: In this study, the potential problems and discrepancies in cill
culture techniques were avoided by isolating leukocytes from the
peripheral blood of patients with cystic fibrosis and healthy human
volunteers and preparing homogenates to determine the specific
activities of 5 lysosomal enzymes involved in the degradation of
glycoproteins. Four lysosomal hydrolases involved in the breakdown of
the carbohydrate side chain were assayed using artificial substrates.
The fifth enzyme, aspartylglucosamine amido hydrolase, which cleaves
the linkage between this side chain and the peptide backbone, was
assayed with natural substrate. No differences in enzyme activities
between the 2 leukocyte sources were observed. Because no enzyme
activities were deficient and no compensatory increases were noted,
we concluded that the thick, glycoprotein-rich, exocrine secretions
in cystic fibrosis cannot be attributed to a defect in their
catabolism.

Texto: The pulmonary function records of 132 patients with cystic fibrosis
followed for 5 to 7 years were reviewed. Changes in forced vital
capacity, 1-sec forced expiratory volume, mean forced expiratory flow
during the middle half of the forced vital capacity, and 1-sec forced
expiratory volume as a percentage of forced vital capacity were
examined. There was considerable variation in the rates of change,
but the general pattern was consistent with a theory of exponential
decline, mean forced expiratory flow during the middle half of the
forced vital capacity showing the earliest and most dramatic changes.
The pulmonary function of 33 patients (25 per cent) remained stable
or improved throughout follow-up, possibly reflecting mild forms of
lung disease or the efficacy of therapy. Twenty of these patients (15
per cent) maintained completely normal pulmonary function. The rate
of decline in pulmonary function values, with progress of the

Texto: The author has attempted to summarize the current state of knowledge
regarding dispositional processes in infants and children of various
ages.  The traditional processes of absorption, distribution,
metabolism, and excretion are described not only in newborn infants
but also in infants and children of other age groups.  Knowledge of
the effects of age and the effects of diseases, which are often
unique to each stage of postnatal development, upon drug action and
disposition is a vital and necessary prerequisite to a discussion of
interactions of drugs of abuse in the pediatric population.  It is
essential that the developmental status of the host be taken into
consideration when examining interactions of drugs in infants and
children.  The mechanisms of interactions are similar to those seen
in the adult patient.  The developmental status of the pediatric
patient also plays a significant role in the manifestations of
disease seen in sick infants and children.  These are often profound
and consequently may play a major role in modifying drug action and
interaction.

Texto: Mucous glycoproteins were isolated by agarose gel filtration from
nonpurulent tracheobronchial secretions and purulent sputum which
had been reduced, carboxymethylated and, in the case of purulent
secretions, treated with deoxyribonuclease.  The solubilized and
purified glycoproteins were fractioned on diethylaminoethyl
cellulose into two major (I, II) and two minor (Ia, III) blood group
active components.  Components I and II had similar carbohydrate and
amino acid compositions which were typical for human blood group
substances.  These two components did differ in several respects.
Component I contained 1.4-2.6% sulfate and did not inhibit influenza
virus hemagglutination while component II contained 7.1-7.8% sulfate
and was a potent inhibitor of virus hemagglutination.  Component II
also migrated more rapidly on sodium dodecyl sulfate-3.3% acrylamide
gel electrophoresis.  Components I and II in purulent secretions
displayed only minor compositional differences from their
counterparts in nonpurulent secretions.  Component II was more
abundant in two sputum samples from subjects with cystic fibrosis
than in purulent bronchitic secretions or in nonpurulent secretions.

Texto: Submandibular secretions collected from children with cystic
fibrosis (CF) showed increased protein concentrations
(milligrams/milliliter) and increased amylase specific activity
(units/milligram of protein) relative to normals secretions.  These
differences between normal (N) and CF secretions were as follows:
protein, 1.25 plus or minus 0.51 (N), 1.75 plus or minus 0.35 (CF)
(P < 0.02); and amylase, 58 plus or minus 18 (N), 80 plus or minus
19 (CF) (P < 0.001).  To determine the basis for elevated protein in
CF saliva, several major proteins resolved by polyacrylamide disc
gel electrophoresis were quantitated by densitometry.  These
included four phosphoproteins (PP), serum albumin, an acid
phosphatase-containing fraction, amylase, and an unidentified
protein referred to as PI-7.1.  Together, these proteins comprise
greater than 75% of the total protein in the secretion.  Differences
in individual protein concentrations (milligrams/milliliter)
resolved from normal and CF secretions, respectively, were as
follows: PP2, 0.02 plus or minus 0.01, 0.03 plus or minus 0.02 (NS,
not significant); PP3, 0.06 plus or minus 0.04, 0.05 plus or minus
0.03 (NS); acid phosphatase fraction, 0.06 plus or minus 0.04, 0.12
plus or minus 0.07 (P < 0.05); amylase, 0.09 plus or minus 0.04,
0.27 plus or minus 0.16 (P < 0.01); and pI-7.1, 0.04 plus or minus
0.02, 0.13 plus or minus 0.08 (P < 0.02).  Amylase, the most
significant contributor to the elevated protein, comprised 26% of
the total protein of normal secretions and 38% of the total protein
of CF secretions.  Thus, our results do not support the concept of a
generalized increase in all organic components in CF submandibular
secretions but, rather, increases in specific proteins, namely
amylase, component pI-7.1, and an acid phosphatase-containing
fraction.

Texto: I read the article by Drs. Robinson and Norman on life tables for
cystic fibrosis with much interest.  They express their
disappointment at not finding any difference between the life
expectancy of children presenting during the first year and that of
all cases.  In fact the former may be a little worse.  Is it not what
should be expected?  Since infection is known to be present as early
as the first month of life, the diagnosis is probably late in nearly
all cases.  Do the authors not point out the necessity of an
evaluation of neonatal screening?  On the other hand, and logically,
one can expect that a very late diagnosis is consistent nowadays with
a very mild case - and the best therapeutic results!  Shwachman's
report of patients over 17 years of age seems to support this belief:
only 12% of the series had been diagnosed before one year of age.
Therefore I think we should evaluate the course of late presenting
cases (after one year of age for instance) separately since a large
delay in diagnosis may be a clue to the mildness of the disease.

Texto: During a screening programme for the detection of CF using the
meconium albumin technique, the overall false-positive rate was found
to be approximately 1%. When the gestational age of the infants was
taken into account the false-positive rate was found to be
significantly higher in preterm (8%) as compared to term infants
(0.55%). This was due largely but not solely to the presence of
occult blood. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed
and attention drawn to the limitation of meconium albumin content as
a screening technique for CF in preterm infants.

of faeces from newborn children at 4-5 days of age has detected 3
cases of cystic fibrosis in the first 6000 tests. No known cases of
cystic fibrosis have been missed. Additionally, one case of
pancreatic achylia of at least 4 months' duration has been detected.
It is proposed that the detection of cystic fibrosis by this
technique is sufficiently practical to be acceptable as a worthwhile
newborn screening programme. The screening test has been in use in
Auckland for over a year and is now being set up in Hamilton,
Wellington, and Dunedin (New Zealand), and Sydney (Australia).

from 9 infants with the disease were analysed for albumin and alpha1-
antitrypsin content. Faeces from infants with no CF had a mean
albumin content of less than 0-1 mg/g dry weight and a mean albumin:
alpha1-antitrypsin ratio value of less than 0-1. Faeces from infants
with CF had, with one exception, an albumin content of more than 2-0
mg/g dry weight and a ratio value greater than 3-0. It was
subsequently found that the duodenal aspirate from the child with CF
but whose faeces had a low albumin content and ratio value, had
tryptic activity though at a much reduced level compared to the

Texto: Immediate skin hypersensitivity to various inhalant allergens was
present in 59% of 123 children with cystic fibrosis (CF), a much
higher percentage than in the general population. This is consistent
with the idea that atopy arises as a result of impaired handling of
antigen at mucosal surfaces. The allergic CF children had more chest
infections, a worse chest x-ray appearance, and lower peak expiratory
flow rates. Allergic diseases were also frequent in the CF obligate
heterozygotes (32% of mothers and 26% of fathers). It is suggested
that the heterozygotes may also have a mucosal abnormality resulting
in defective antigen handling.

Texto: Mucociliary tracheal transport rates were measured in 20 patients
with cystic fibrosis, in whom these rates ranged from 0 to 12.8
mm/min. The patients were divided into 3 roughly equal groups on the
basis of their transport rates. (1) Those in whom no abnormality in
mucociliary transport was detected in the trachea; (2) those in whom
normal transport rates were measured but in whom abnormalities such
as cessation, or reversal of bolus movement were observed; (3) those
in whom no normal transport rates were observed. In the first group
the rates were similar to those observed in a population of healthy
adults. These normal rates were observed in some patients who had a
productive cough. The mean mucociliary tracheal transport rate
increased with increasing maximum midexpiratory flow. Those patients
with a low Shwachman score and poor arterial oxygen tension tended to
fall into groups 2 and 3. In the ciliary dyskinesia assay in rabbit
trachea the serum from the patients with the higher transport rates
tended to initiate more rapid discharge of material from the

There are marked differences between the normal children and the

occurred in a chronically ill 11-year-old boy with cystic fibrosis.
As in cases in adults, chronic illness, long-term anabolic steroid

the causative factors in this case. Histologically, the phlebectatic
and parenchymal types, which were presumed to be separate, were found
conjointly in this case. This is compatible with its origin from
severe right ventricular congestive failure. The rarity of peliosis,
however, indicates that one or more as yet unknown factors might be
operative in its development.

were made over three decades ago.  More recently, physiological
findings have directed investigation toward a plethora of humoral
substances and their possible role in disturbances of the secretory

biology and of tissue culture is beginning to increase our knowledge
about the so-called CF factors and their diverse effects on

controlling the processes of secretion.  Some current theories as to

to determine which test or tests were the best in identifying
children with airways disease, to determine the severity of disease
and to document response to therapy.  Maximum expiratory flow,
measured from a maximum expiratory flow volume curve, and maximum
mid-expiratory flow measured from a spirogram, were the most
sensitive tests in detecting early disease.  Maximum expiratory flow
measured from the maximum expiratory flow volume curve, combined
with measurement of lung volumes, gave the best overall estimate of
severity.  Peak expiratory flow rate measured with a Peak Flow
Meter, because of its simplicity of measurement, was the most useful
test for routine use in the clinic and consulting room to monitor

Texto: Cystic fibrosis at one time was considered to be a lethal condition
with death occurring at birth or within the first year of life.  With
the advent of antibiotic therapy, pancreatic enzyme replacement,
extensive physical therapy and generally improved medical treatment,
many patients now survive to adulthood.  Clinical manifestations in
CF vary from patient to patient and may include pulmonary disease,
malnutrition, pancreatic insufficiency and defective ion transport.
The most reliable laboratory method for diagnosis of CF is testing
for elevated sweat electrolyte levels.  Estimates of the incidence of
CF vary from 1 in 2000 to 1 in 3500 among white populations of
mid-European heritage.  The disease is rare in black populations and
almost non-existent in Orientals.  Since 1967 there has been an
intensive search for a circulating factor or factors which may be
directly or indirectly responsible for the malfunctions manifest in
this disease.  Sweat factors, serum factors, metachromasia, bioassay
variations, and properties of the ciliary inhibitor are discussed.
Several groups working in CF research have centered their attention
on the serum complement system.  Agglutination and mucus factors,
transport studies, enzyme studies, and prenatal diagnosis are also
examined.

components as a possible cause of the abnormality, blood was
fractionated using Rabinowitz's glass bead technique and Boyum's
Ficoll-Hypaque method. Free (unconjugated) polyamines were  extracted
with perchloric acid and quantitated on an amino acid analyzer. In
controls, mean +/- SEM concentrations in nmoles/10(9) cells of Spd
and Spm, respectively, were 1.02 +/- 0.08 and 0.894 +/- 0.28 for
erythrocytes; 126 +/- 31 and 357 +/- 105 for lymphocytes; 36 +/- 16
and 240 +/- 33 for granulocytes; and less than 0.5 and less than 0.5
nmoles/ml for plasma. When converted to the concentration in whole
blood, it was found that greater than 90% of Spd and over 70% of Spm
was associated with erythrocytes. While the higher cellular
concentration in leukocytes was not unexpected, the fact that Spd and
Spm in whole blood were primarily associated with erythrocytes was a
new finding. Comparison with controls revealed that the Spd/Spm ratio
in both whole blood and erythrocytes was significantly higher in the

Texto: We agree with the comment of Dr Feighery and Mr Woods that a low
migration index signifies sensitivity to an antigen which can be
achieved only by functionally active immunocompetent cells.  However,
we must emphasise that the functions of active immunocompetent cells
may or may not be impaired, depending upon the antigens to which such
cells are sensitised.  Since comparative cells from age-matched
controls and from blood donors did not show such sensitisation to
those antigens to which the cystic fibrosis cells were sensitised
then there is no doubt that the normal function of these
immunocompetent cells in the patients with CF is indeed impaired.
When one considers that steroids are known immunosuppressants it is
certainly not surprising that treatment of the CF patients with
prednisolone caused a decreased sensitivity of these sensitised CF
cells to the antigens.  Indeed, therapeutic concentrations of
steroids were able to reduce the ability of sensitised spleen cells
and of lymph-node cells to destroy target cells in vitro.  Apart from
this inhibition of sensitised cells by steroids, 90% of sensitised
lymphocytes were killed when prednisolone 1 mg/l was present during
the sensitisation phase.  In addition it was observed in man that if
cortisol or prednisolone was given two hours before abrading the
skin, then there occurred a marked reduction of emigrations of both
mononuclear cells and polymorphs into the area, thus inhibiting the
mobilisation of macrophages.  We believe that the situation with
regard to steroid therapy and inhibition of migration of leukocytes
from CF patients is similar.

"the great imitator."  Many organ systems are involved, and a clear
understanding of the disease and its many complications is a useful
exercise in understanding human physiology.  CF could be called
thick-secretion disease, because all exocrine fluids, like pancreatic
juice, are thick, or it could be called multimystery disease, because
there are so many unanswered questions about it.  Many manifestations
of CF are understandable complications of malabsorption, malnutrition
and the physical and chemical effects of abnormal exocrine secretion;
others, including the susceptibility to recurrent nasal polyps, the
hypersalinized sweat, low female fertility and male sterility, given

Texto: Injections of serum from human patients with cystic fibrosis into
adult rats caused pronounced structural modifications and increased
mitotic rate in the parotid gland. Mitotic rate was increased from a
low level of 0.02/1,000 acinar cells in parotid glands of adult rats
to 6.5/1,000 acinar cells after 2 or 3 days of serum injection. At
the light and electron microscopic levels, significant acinar cell
atrophy and degranulation were observed. Cellular necrosis, and
increases in quantity of lysosome-like dense bodies, mast cells, and
macrophages were also detected. These changes are suggestive of
tissue response to injurious foreign protein. Furthermore, the fact
that normal sera pronounced the same kind of effects (but greatly
reduced in extent) strengthens the view that these effects result
from the immunologic response of the host organ to foreign antigen.
Since, however, the responses of the rat parotid to cystic fibrosis
serum were considerably more marked than those elicited by normal
serum, the rat parotid may thus have potential usefulness in assaying
for the presence of human cystic fibrosis factor.

examine the secretory IgA (SIgA) system in different body fluids from
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). Free J-chain was detected in all

isolated from normal human colostrum. In addition the free SC from
some CF saliva formed precipitin lines of partial identity with
normal human saliva or colostrum. A higher proportion of CF sera
(33%) than of normal sera (10%) contained free SC. These
investigations suggest that there may be some defect in the synthesis
and/or the assembly of the SIgA immunoglobulins, which if confirmed,
may help to explain the impaired Type I and Type III allergic

duodenal contents, liver, spleen, serum and urine, and purified 15--

isolated enzymes formed two distinct groups: (a) The ribonucleases of
the pancreas, duodenal contents and fraction A of serum and urine
exhibit a pH optimum of 8.5, are inhibited by An2+ and Cu2+, and
relatively rapidly hydrolyze the synthetic substrate uridine 3'-

spleen, and of fractions B of the serum and urine, with a pH optimum
of 7, are less sensitive to An2+ and Cu2+, and exhibit negligible
activity versus uridine 3'-(alpha-naphthylphosphate). Determination
of the serum level of pancreatic-type ribonuclease activity, with the
use of uridine 3'-(alpha-naphthylphosphate) or RNA as substrates,

the seven isoenzymes of normal liver alpha-L-fucosidase was

L-fucosidase appear to be related to the most neutral form by sialic

appear to be related by sialic acid residues, it is possible that the
altered alpha-L-fucosidase isoenzyme patterns found in cystic

the vitamin and at three and five hours after administration. Serum
vitamin A levels were estimated using the Carr-Price technique. The
percentages of patients with normal vitamin A absorption were 85 with
vitamin A alcohol in oil-water emulsion, 61 with vitamin A alcohol
dissolved in oil, 64 with vitamin A palmitate in oil-water emulsion,
and 19 with vitamin A palmitate in oil. The number of stools per day
is an inverse indicator of retention time in the intestine.
Absorption of fat soluble vitamins is always abnormal when a patient
has four or more stools a day. The observations that cystic fibrosis
patients with abnormal liver biopsies have poor absorption of vitamin
A were not statistically significant. The question of the effect of
cirrhosis in cystic fibrosis on vitamin A absorption remains
unresolved.

Texto: Sera from 32 patients with cystic fibrosis classified according to
fibroblast metachromasia into three classes have been analysed
immunochemically for the concentrations of 18 serum proteins.  In
addition, the clinical and radiological status of the lungs were
evaluated, using two scoring systems.  Eleven of 16 serum proteins
differed from the values of a thousand-donor serum pool.  The most
pronounced differences from the control sera were elevated
acute-phase proteins, notably haptoglobin, alpha1-antichymotrypsin,
IgG, and IgA, and low serum albumin and alpha2-HS-glycoprotein.
Patients from metachromatic class III presented the most pronounced
rise in acute-phase proteins and, furthermore, significantly
decreased complement C3 and IgM, IgG and IgA were normal in class III
patients.  These differences from the control sera possibly reflect
inflammatory tissue damage involving immune reactions.  The clinical
score was positively correlated to the radiologic score, and both
these scores were positively correlated to the concentrations of
eight and seven, respectively, of the serum proteins, and negatively
correlated to three of the serum proteins.  Based upon the
correlations between the scores and the concentrations of some of the
serum proteins, it is recommended that longitudinal prospective
studies follow individual patients for the concentrations in serum of
haptoglobin, albumin, IgA, IgG, C3, and, eventually, IgM and
alpha1-antichymotrypsin.  The present results suggest that these
serum proteins will yield valuable information as regards prognosis
and therapy of the lung disease in CF.

Texto: Unusual increases in the minor hemoglobin components (Hb AIa, b, c)
known to be elevated in diabetes mellitus were found in states of
relative or absolute insulinopenia: diabetic ketoacidosis, steroid-
induced diabetes, insulin-dependent diabetes in cystic-fibrosis
patients, and cystic fibrosis occurring in infants who have a marked
suppression of insulin secretion. In ketoacidotic diabetics, it
required at least a month for high Hb AI levels (16.9 +/- 2.6 per
cent) to stabilize at nonacidotic levels (12.8 +/- 0.3 per cent),
suggesting that decreases occur only as new red cells form under
conditions less favorable to Hb AI synthesis. Abnormal amounts os Hb
A and Hb AI resisted removal from diabetic red-cell membranes by low
ionic buffers but yielded to hypotonic Tris buffer. Their removal
resulted in simultaneous elution of peripheral and integral membrane
proteins. It is suggested that Hb so firmly bound could reduce
membrane elasticity and cell deformability, characteristics so vital
to normal red cell movement through the microvasculature.

Texto: A simple and rapid method for the diagnosis of steatorrhea is
described. The method is based on the assessment of the difference of
specific gravity and lipophilic property between a normal stool and
that in steatorrhea, using a benzene-NaBr system. The stool samples
are dried, pulverized, and then investigated. Steatorrhea is defined
either as a fat or more in a 24-hour sample. Stool samples of 71
infants and children were examined. Among these were 23 healthy
subjects, 10 with upper respiratory tract infections, and 6 with
pneumonia. A further 31 children had celiac disease, 9 of them were
on a gluten-free diet, and one child had cystic fibrosis. The
procedure described renders single stool samples suitable for the
assessment of steatorrhea. As a screening test the method proved to
be rapid and accurate in the diagnosis of steatorrhea.

Texto: Normal values of mean cell volume (M.C.V.) and of distribution of
single cell volumes (S.C.V.) have been observed in erythrocytes of
patients with cystic fibrosis using an electronical particle-volume
analyzer (sheath flow detector). From these results a strong defect
in red cell salt transport seems improbable. Valinomucin induces
shrinking (by increase of K+ permeability) and gramicidin D induces
swelling (by increase of Na+ permeability) of normal erythrocytes.
Addition of C.F. sweat to normal erythrocytes induces no volume
change. From this result no influence of the "C.F. factor" on passive
ion permeability is concluded.

children and 62 healthy adults the serum alpha1-fetoprotein
concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. In cystic fibrosis
patients 97.5% and in normal children 95% of the alpha1-fetoprotein
values were within the normal range for healthy adults (1--9 ng/ml).
Critical judgement of the reported findings in literature and our own
results demonstrate that the investigation of alpha1-fetoprotein in
the serum cannot serve for detecting homozygotes of cystic fibrosis
genes or heterozygote carriers.

Texto: The interrelationship of enterokinase and trypsin activities were
investigated in 133 infants and children with a variety of
gastrointestinal and pancreatic disorders. Fourteen patients with
diarrhea and grade II mucosal injury revealed a significant (P less

activites as compared to 59 children with normal mucosa. Nine
patients with cystic fibrosis and pancreatic insufficiency had normal
mucosal enterokinase activity and elevated intraluminal enterokinase
activity with very low or no trypsin activity. Patients with
hypoproteinemia and gastrointestinal protein loss, associated with
intestinal lymphangiectasia (4 patients) and intestinal lymphoid
nodular hyperplasia (3 patients), had normal or insignificant
decrease of enterokinase and trypsin activities. In patients with
steatorrhea, a normal sweat test, normal intestinal mucosa, and
absent trypsin activity, two entities were defined. One group (3
patients) was diagnosed as Schwachman-Diamond syndrome with
pancreatic insufficiency and normal mucosal and intraluminal
enterokinase activity. The second group (2 patients) with absent
mucosal and intraluminal enterokinase activity and normal lipase and
amylase activities was diagnosed as congenital enterokinase
deficiency.

Texto: Fifteen (2.2%) of 693 patients with cystic fibrosis seen over an 18-
year period developed clinical hepatic disease. In 13 patients all
symptoms were secondary to portal hypertension. Ten had hypersplenism
and 6 had variceal bleeding, including 3 who developed both
conditions. All 5 patients who survived the initial episode of
gastrointestinal bleeding underwent portal systemic shunting. A
shunting procedure also was performed on 1 patients with
hypersplenism but no variceal bleeding. No subsequent deterioration
of intellectual function occurred in either the shunted or unshunted
patients. Only 1 of the shunted patients showed progression of
hepatic disease after surgery. These results suggest that portal
systemic shunting is useful in the treatment of bleeding esophageal
varices in cystic fibrosis. A sweat test to rule out cystic fibrosis
should be included in the evaluation of any teenage or young adult
patient with unexplained portal hypertension.

Texto: This review is concerned with the disturbances in bile flow that
occur early in life.  Although cholestasis is defined
physiologically, it can be considered to have morphological features.
Morphological cholestasis is the presence of bile pigments in
histopathological sections of the liver and is most easily recognized
as bile plugs or thrombi in bile canaliculi.  Physiological
cholestasis, a reduction in bile flow, is inferred from the finding
of an elevated serum bile acid.  This inference is derived from the
known positive correlation between canalicular bile flow and bile
acid excretion that has been found to occur in all species this far
examined, including man.  An increase in the amount of bile acid in
plasma implies a reduction in the hepatic transport of the primary
conjugated bile acids of man and therefore a decrease in associated
canalicular bile flow.  Classifications of cholestatic syndromes,
functional abnormalities, and therapy for cholestasis syndromes are
discussed.

Texto: Bile acid loss (mg/m2 24h) in the stools of 43 cystic fibrosis (CF)
children with pancreatic insufficiency was 751-1 +/- 48-3, while that
of six without clinical evidence of pancreatic disease (133-4 +/- 15-
9) did not differ from values in 25 controls (109-8 +/- 9-8). There
was a good correlation between the degree of bile acid (BA) and fat
sequestration. Concomitant changes in bile acid and fat loss were
observed in the one group of six patients studied on and off
pancreatic enzymes as well as in a second group of seven children
treated with pancreatic supplements and maintained on a normal diet
followed by a low fat diet supplemented with medium chain
triglycerides. Administration of NA bicarbonate led to a significant
decrease in fat loss (15-8 +/- 2-7 leads to 10-3 +/- 1-9) without any
simultaneous change in bile acid excretion (533-1 +/- 58-3 leads to
500-4 +/- 58-6). Qualitative bile acid patterns in controls, in
infants after an ileal resection, and in patients with CF or with
coeliac disease showed that the percentage of primary BA followed
closely the total amount excreted except in situations where
antibiotics were administered. The exact mechanism for the increased
loss of BA in CF is unknown. It is found in all age groups and is
related to the presence and degree of pancreatic insufficiency. The
possibility that unhydrolysed triglycerides may interfere with the
intestinal absorption of bile acid needs further confirmation.

Texto: The autopsies of 82 patients with cystic fibrosis were reviewed with
respect to pathologic changes in the lungs and their respective
prevalence among different age groups. Although bronchitis,
mucopurulent plugging, and bronchopneumonia were almost universally
present among children of all ages, epithelial metaplasia and
bronchiectasis were rarer among infants and progressively more
prevalent in older age groups. Emphysema was absent in patients under
two years of age and affected 11 per cent of the patients two to six
years of age and 40 per cent of the patients older than six years,
but was never of a severe degree by the point count method. Pulmonary
hemorrhage, although uncommon, was usually associated with prominent
arterial vessels in walls of bronchiectatic airways. Quantitative
assessment of bronchial glands revealed Reid indices significantly
higher in patients with cystic fibrosis when compared to noncystic
fibrosis patients, but there was no increase in these indices with
the age of the patients. Glandular hypertrophy, predominance of
mucous acini within glands, and goblet cell hyperplasia of the
bronchial mucosa all suggest an explanation for the copious mucous
secretion of patients with cystic fibrosis. However, it was not
possible to ascertain whether these findings reflect a general
exocrine defect of such patients or whether they were merely a
response to chronic airway infection, even though the latter is a
more plausible assumption.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis has been a difficult problem to solve.  One amino
acid is not found in elevated concentrations in the urine, one
abnormal sugar or polysaccharide is not found in secretions of the
bronchial tree which causes pulmonary damage, and a unique material
which inhibits sodium transport has not yet been identified in sweat.
Instead of viewing the current state of CF research as chaotic,
perhaps we should say in a positive way that the diversity of ideas
stimulates thinking, and in the process of sorting out the primary
defect, a wide spectrum of pathophysiologic changes will be
recognized.  Recently a positive-charged polypeptide associated with
immunoglobulin G has been identified which may be responsible for the
ciliary dyskinesis effect of CF serum.  This material should
demonstrate the same properties when bound to immunoglobulin G from
control sera.  It would be interesting if it were identical with the
basic protein recently found only in the serum and IgG fraction of CF
patients and carriers.  Further work may identify how the polypeptide
affects cell membrane surfaces, and whether a defective peptidase,
perhaps an arginine esterase, fails to break down the polypeptide.  A
unifying hypothesis could then emerge and tie biochemical and
physiological findings together.

Texto: To geneticists, cystic fibrosis, perhaps the most frequently
encountered genetic disease among Caucasians of European origin,
presents an enigmatic dilemma on various levels.  Those problem areas
which complicate our understanding of this disease include methods of
diagnosis, ascertainment, and analysis and interpretation of data.
In spite of an apparently clear-cut mode of inheritance (autosomal
recessive), several conceptual difficulties exist in the acceptance
of this formal transmission pattern.  The most pressing problem of
all, perhaps, is the population genetics of CF.  The fact that a
lethal gene may be maintained at such elevated frequencies and
restricted to given population groups represents a seemingly genetic
paradox.  Our aim is to review some of the problems encountered in a
genetic study of CF and to propose a theoretical model which may help
in their elucidation.  Topics discussed include problems of
diagnosis, ascertainment, and data analysis; family studies and
inferences as to the mode of inheritance; population studies; and a
proposed model for the inheritance of CF.  The main tenet of this
model states that CF is determined by dominant alleles at two
autosomal loci, with interaction between them.

Texto: Because of the prominent role of infection in cystic fibrosis, and
because of the genetic nature of both cystic fibrosis and specific
immune defects, considerable effort has been expended in determining
if there are hereditary immune defects in cystic fibrosis patients
that render them susceptible to infection.  Against a congenital
immune defect is the fact that the infections nearly always are
localized to the lung with the same two organisms, rather than
infections at multiple sites involving multiple organisms.  Specific
immune mechanisms in the B and T cell systems are examined.
Nonspecific host defense mechanisms include the complement system,
phagocytosis, pulmonary clearance, the pulmonary barrier to the
systemic spread of infection, protease inhibitors, and factor
XIII-dependent systems.  Hypersensitivity states include allergy and
atopy, allergic aspergillosis, immune complex disease, and
hypersensitivity to pancreatic extracts.  The presence or absence of
specific antigen components and the association of HL-A antigens are

obstruction of one type or another, documented or presumed.  They are
modified by the age of the individual, the severity and the
conditions peculiar to each tissue.  These lesions, plus the
functional changes in sweat electrolytes, membrane transport and
serum factor affecting syncrony of cilia, represent the diverse
actions of a genetic defect, the intermediate stages of which are as

severity, nor differences in the age of onset argue convincingly for
a trigger mechanism or acquire rather than inborn deficiency.

Texto: The general area of research at the biochemical and molecular levels
related to cystic fibrosis has suffered from the lack of a suitable
animal model.  Although some animal models have been proposed, these
have not yet been tested.  In attempts to circumvent this problem
several investigators have turned to cell culture techniques to study
various aspects of cystic fibrosis.  These studies have included the
use of red blood cells, lymphocytes, skin fibroblasts and cultured
nasal polyps.  There are enough positive indications from this
approach to indicate that it might be fruitful.  Consequently, a
final aspect of this article will be a consideration of the use of
cell cultures for future investigations into the possible metabolic
lesions in cystic fibrosis.  Control of cyclic nucleotide levels in
parotid, the role of calcium, microfilaments and microtubules in
secretion, and the use of cell cultures as an approach to the study
of biochemical defects in cystic fibrosis are discussed.

Texto: Determination of fibroblast proliferation rates and RNA methylation
patterns in our laboratory has revealed no alteration in cells from
cystic fibrosis patients.  Blood polyamines are located predominantly
in erythrocytes with low concentrations in plasma; sweat has likewise
been shown to have a low content of spermidine and spermine.  Whole
blood polyamine concentrations fluctuate from one individual to
another and are especially variable in females subject to the
hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle.  Because of the variability
in the spermidine and spermine content of blood, it is useful to
express such data on the basis of the spermidine/spermine ratio;
however, results must be analyzed according to sex and, in the case
of females, should be interpreted in relationship to the menstrual
cycle.  Spermidine/spermine ratios are significantly elevated in
whole blood extracts and isolated erythrocytes from male CF homo-
and heterozygotes.

Texto: Defective mucociliary transport has been implicated in the
pathogenesis of the lung disease in cystic fibrosis, based on
several observations.  First, patients with the disease secrete more
mucus than normal subjects, as indicated by gland hypertrophy, and
frequently retain it in the lung.  Second, the mucus is said to have
altered biochemical and rheological properties; however, although the
physiochemical properties of mucus are altered in all lung diseases,
little histochemical or rheological difference has been found in
mucus from patients with CF and other hypersecretory conditions such
as chronic bronchitis and bronchiectasis.  Third, a factor in the
serum of CF patients inhibits normal ciliary activity in explain
glands of ciliated epithelium; and infection, which damages human
ciliated epithelium in culture, could further reduce mucociliary
transport.  Measurement of pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis,
physical fitness and response to exercise in cystic fibrosis, control
of breathing in patients with cystic fibrosis, regional lung function
in cystic fibrosis, and therapy of cystic fibrosis are discussed.

Texto: This report summarizes selected aspects of pulmonary therapy for
cystic fibrosis.  Since the results of chronic bronchopulmonary
infection are the cause of death in most CF patients, improved
patient survival patterns may possibly be attributed in large part to
improvements in antibiotic therapy and increased therapeutic
aggressiveness.  Mist tent therapy was defined and initiated in the
1950s, but later studies of mist tent therapy have not shown
beneficial response in many patients selected for study.
Intermittent aerosol therapy continues to be employed by many
physicians to deliver medication rather than bulk liquid to the
bronchial mucosa.  Pulmonary endoscopy and lavage, expectorants,
allergic aspergillosis, pneumothorax, lobectomy, and hemoptysis are
also examined.

Texto: Early investigators employed histochemical, chemical and
physiochemical techniques in an attempt to identify differences
between cystic fibrosis and control mucous secretions.  Several
mucous glycoprotein abnormalities were suggested by their studies.
In retrospect, none of these studies achieved their goal of
describing a fundamental mucous glycoprotein abnormality peculiar to
CF.  Improved methods have been devised for the collection of mucous
glycoproteins in human respiratory tract secretions and the study of
their chemical and physical properties.  Therefore, it is now
possible to make preliminary comparisons between human
tracheobronchial mucous glycoproteins from CF and non-CF sources.
General properties of mucous glycoproteins, human tracheobronchial
mucous glycoproteins, comparison of CF and non-CF tracheobronchial
mucous glycoprotein, and suggested directions for future studies of
CF mucous secretions are discussed.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis is a recessively inherited metabolic disease which is
characterized by a universal dysfunction in the exocrine glands of
affected individuals.  This dysfunction results in abnormalities of
the composition and/or the physiochemical behavior of the various
exocrine gland products.  Although significant advances have been
made in our understanding of exocrine gland physiology and
pharmacology, many questions remain unanswered and significant gaps
exist in our knowledge of exocrine gland function.  Perhaps
clarification of these issues may lead to better understanding of the
pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis and to development of better forms of
therapy for the patients.  The purpose of this article is to review
past and present developments in this area of biomedical research and
to point out areas of exocrine gland physiology and pharmacology
where more knowledge is needed in order to clarify the nature of a
disease like cystic fibrosis.  Composition of the acinar fluid,
secretory mechanisms, modification of ductal fluid, ionic dependence
and energy requirements of the secretory process, calcium metabolism
in exocrine glands, and exocrine gland dysfunction in cystic fibrosis
are discussed.

Texto: It has been recognized that the levels of water and electrolytes are
deranged in many, if not all, of the exocrine secretions of cystic
fibrosis patients.  The sodium and chloride levels in serous
secretions from CF patients are elevated.  In contrast, the more
protein-rich or mucoid, isotonic secretions (viz, from the pancreas
and tracheobronchial mucus glands) are found to have sodium
concentrations near normal or even somewhat decreased.  However,
these secretions have significantly reduced water content.  The
abnormalities in hypotonic secretions appear to rise from a decreased
Na+ reabsorption in the ducts.  The low water content of the isotonic
secretions of CF patients appears to result from decreased secretion
of water and electrolytes.  Early studies on tracheobronchial
secretions from CF patients led investigators to suggest that the
primary defect may be a decrease in the levels of water and
monovalent ions.  In an attempt to provide a unifying hypothesis, it
has been suggested that an increased calcium concentration in the
various exocrine secretions leads to a "hyperpermeability" of the
mucus linings and thus to an excessive loss of water and small ions.
The concentration of calcium in exocrine secretions appears to follow
the concentration of proteins and especially the mucous
glycoproteins.  It was suggested that calcium may be an important
factor in the increased viscosity and insolubility of CF mucus.
Organic ions are also potential perturbants of macromolecular
structure.  In addition to a possible perturbant role, polyamines
have a potential role in water and electrolyte transport.

Texto: Although complex models involving multiple loci may be plausible, the
high frequency of cystic fibrosis in Caucasians is probably best
explained by selective advantage for the heterozygote carrier.  In
short, an analogy of cystic fibrosis with hemoglobin S sickle cell
anemia may be greater than with Tay-Sachs disease in terms of
molecular mechanisms.  Protein and polypeptide differences have been
reported for the humoral fluids of cystic fibrosis patients and their
heterozygotic relatives in connected with selected bioassay systems.
These directions relate to a model here proposed for the intermediate
stages of the physiology of cystic fibrosis, which builds on a large
body of elegant experimental work.  The basic tenet is that the cells
of cystic fibrosis heterozygotes and normal individuals are in a
stimulatory loop.  Chronic reserpine treatment exaggerates in the
normal rat a loop similar to the one exaggerated by genetic
differences in the human, elevating to pathological levels an
otherwise normal process.

knowledge of the gastrointestinal manifestations and absorption and
metabolism of nutrients in patients with cystic fibrosis.  The
gastrointestinal manifestations include pancreatic exocrine

complications of malabsorption.  Nutritional aspects of cystic
fibrosis include growth retardation and body composition, fat and
nitrogen absorption, amino acid absorption, medium-chain triglyceride

questions for projection into the future fall into three categories:
intestinal absorption, gastrointestinal function and experimental

cystic fibrosis genotypes and synthesized in vitro by cultured cells
from these genotypes by functional disturbances observed in the
assays employed.  Preliminary characterizations of these factors are
in general agreement and the properties include a small molecular
weight polypeptide within the range of 4000 to 10000 MW, a
heat-labile protein having a cationic charge, and a protein present
in saliva, serum, urine (and perhaps sweat) which is synthesized in
vitro by fibroblasts, short-term lymphocytes and long-term lymphoid
lines.  The relationship of the factor or factors to the pathogenesis
of cystic fibrosis is presently unknown, but its presence in cystic
fibrosis genotypes appears to be related to the basic defect.

Texto: It has been reported that saliva and serum of patients contain
macromolecular "factors" which are presumably cationic and inhibit
transport of electrolytes, induce dyskinesis or degranulate
sensitized polymorphonuclear leukocytes and contain polypeptide
moieties.  The difference between levels of trypsin-like activity of
mixed saliva of patients with cystic fibrosis and controls has been
confirmed.  A number of studies have been carried out in order to
determine if a deficiency of proteolytic activity might account for
the presence of cystic fibrosis serum factors.  It was presumed that
the observed partial deficiency of arginine esterase activity might
well represent the total deficiency of one of several arginine
esterases assayed under the experimental conditions.  Although it was
postulated that the deficiency of arginine esterase activity is
related to the elevation of the levels of polypeptide or protein
"factors", the hydrolysis of peptide bands by activated plasma could
not be demonstrated, probably due to the limitations of the methods
employed.  The deficiency of plasma arginine esterase in cystic
fibrosis has been questioned and confirmed in another laboratory.

children live longer, the number may be higher.  Clinical diagnosis,
management, prognosis, echocardiography, echocardiography as a

Texto: The interactions of Pseudomonas aeruginosa with humoral factors in
the sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis were investigated by
using an indirect immunofluorescent technique. Fluorescein-
conjugated, monovalent antiserum specific to heavy chains of human
immunoglobulin A (IgA), IgG, or IgM and to complement C3 were used.
All strains of P. aeruginosa recovered from the sputum specimens of
patients with cystic fibrosis were found to be coated with antibodies
of IgA, IgG, and IgM classes and with C3. The specificity of the
antibody coating was determined. The fluorescence was most intense
with IgA and was followed in intensity by IgG, IgM, and C3. No
difference was noted between rough and mucoid strains of P.
aeruginosa. When the subcultured P. aeruginosa was incubated with the
sputum eluates, a similar pattern of fluorescence was demonstrated,
indicating that these humoral factors are present in the sputum and
that the coating process can take place in the lower respiratory
tract of the patients. By single radial immunodiffusion, significant
quantities of the humoral factors in the sputum eluates were
detected. These findings suggest that P. aeruginosa is opsonized in
sputum of patients with cystic fibrosis.

Texto: The present communication reports the effect of the bacterial mucus
on the activity of antibodies on strains of P. aeruginosa.  Mucoid
variants of P. aeruginosa obtained from the non-mucoid strains PAO
381 and PAT 404 by selection for phenotypic resistance to the
virulent phage E 79 were more resistant to carbenicillin than the
non-mucoid parent strains.  Mucoid P. aeruginosa strains isolated
from two CF patients were more resistant to carbenicillin than
non-mucoid strains isolated from the same samples of sputum.  When
the experiments already described were repeated with oxytetracycline,
in contrast to our experience with carbenicillin, mucoid strains were
found to be more sensitive than non-mucoid strains.  To prove the
hypothesis that mucoid strains can be selected in vivo by

Texto: Cystic fibrosis is the most common autosomal recessive disorder in
Great Britain, Central Europe and North America and it affects 1 in
2000 live born children.  Does the antibiotic treatment in cystic
fibrosis differ from the treatment of respiratory infection in other
conditions?  The cystic fibrosis patient not only suffers progressive
deterioration in respiratory function; he often has dangerous
complicating conditions culminating in super-infection by highly
resistant organisms.  The basic principle of antibiotic therapy must
be rigidly applied in cystic fibrosis.  The first principle is to
identify the pathogen and its susceptibility to antibiotics.  The
second principle is to ensure that the chosen antibiotic reaches the
site of infection.  The third principle is that the antibiotic
therapy ought to complement the immunological defences of the
patient.  A fourth principle is that no therapy must be given
without first deciding upon the criteria which will be acceptable as
indicating clinical improvement.

Texto: Although similar fractions of cells were in the S phase of the cell
cycle, normal human skin fibroblasts were shown to incorporate more
than twice the 3HTdR into their DNA in vitro than did cells obtained
from individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF). Obligate heterozygotes
incorporated an intermediate amount of the DNA precursor. Studied
were initiated to determine the basis of the differential
incorporation of 3HTdR among the genotypes. An analog of thymidine,
BUdR, produced varied effects on the growth kinetics of the three
genotypes. The growth of cells in BUdR resulted in a 50% increase in
the population doubling times of all three genotypes, and caused the
cell morphology to change from a spindle shape to one in which the
cells became broadened and flat, with numerous cytoplasmic
projections extending for distances of several cell diameters. The
activities of thymidine kinase and the participation of the exogenous
and de novo pathways in the synthesis of TMP were found to be
approximately the same in all three genotypes. The data suggest that
an alteration in the transport of thymidine into the cells may
account for the differences in TdR incorporation into DNA, and this
may be associated with other changes in cystic fibrosis that are
apparently membrane associated.

strains of influenza A virus, was evaluated in a double-blind trial
in 153 children with cystic fibrosis during the initial appearance of
influenza A/England/42 virus in the New England area. Infection with
this variant strain of influenza virus did not reach epidemic
proportions during the study, so that the effectiveness of amantadine
in this study population could not be fully assessed. However, the
potential symptomatic and biochemical toxicity of amantadine was
carefully monitored in a pediatric population. Serologic screening by
complement fixation tests indicated that respiratory viruses may be
important pathogens in exacerbations of respiratory disease in

Pseudomonas aeruginosa in patients with cystic fibrosis were studied
in 15 patients with moderate-to-severe exacerbation of chronic
pulmonary infection. Seventeen courses of treatment were given.
Tobramycin (5-7.5 mg/kg per day) was administered intravenously in
three divided doses per day (seven to 21 days). All specimens of
sputum yielded moderate-to-heavy growth of P. aeruginosa; all
isolates were inhibited by 4 mug of tobramycin/ml, and in seven cases
isolates were not inhibited by 4 mug of gentamicin/ml. The mean
levels of tobramycin in the blood were 4.4 mug/ml 0.5-1 hr and 0.8
mug/ml 7.5-8 hr after administration. All patients received an
antistaphylococcal agent before, during, and after therapy. All
patients except for two received 750 mg of carbenicillin/kg per day
intravenously in six divided doses and 1 g of carbenicillin in a mask
for inhalation three times a day. Both clinical and radiological
improvement was noted in all patients. The white blood cell count,
which was elevated in seven patients, returned to normal, and levels
of blood gases improved. P. aeruginosa was eliminated from the sputum
in five cases. No adverse side effects were noted.

conventional as well as larger doses of tobramycin. The infection was
eradicated in four of the 17 patients treated, but the duration of
follow-up study of one patient was short. It appeared that treatment
was most successful in those patients in whom the highest peak
concentrations of tobramycin in sputum were obtained. No side effects

Texto: Patients who had cystic fibrosis and acute infectious exacerbations
of pulmonary disease produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa were treated
with a combination of tobramycin and ticarcillin. P. aeruginosa
recovered from patients was inhibited by lower concentrations of both
of these drugs than of gentamicin or carbenicillin. Thirteen courses
of treatment were administered to 11 patients (mean, 14.4 days). A
favorable response was seen in 11 of 12 completed courses of
treatment. Improvement was associated with decreases in white blood
cell count, temperature, and sedimentation rate. Adverse reactions
were uncommon. Although P. aeruginosa was not eradicated from the
sputum, the clinical results suggest that the combination of
tobramycin and ticarcillin may be particularly useful for treatment
of acute exacerbations of pulmonary disease in patients with cystic
fibrosis from whom P. aeruginosa is isolated.

pancreas (CFP), 17 of whom had pancreatic insufficiency (PI), and of
34 normal control subjects was separated into its pancreatic and
salivary components and quantitated. Electrophoretic separation was
achieved on polyacrylamide disc gels with subsequent sectioning of
the gel columns. The amylase content in international units per liter
(IU/L.) was obtained for each section by the insoluble blue starch
substrate method. The mean total serum amylase of the CFP patients
with PI was significantly lower than the control group. A highly
significant decrease was found when the pancreatic isoamylase was
considered alone. The salivary isoamylase level remained essentially
the same. Three patients with CFP but without PI demonstrated higher
than normal pancreatic amylase values in the serum. These patients
may be in an early stage of a progressive involvement of the pancreas
in which there is an increased release of amylase. This method of
electrophoretic separation and quantitation of the serum amylase is
sensitive and efficient and allows the simultaneous processing of
multiple specimens. The results obtained agree with previously
published ratios of serum isoamylases. Our method should be valuable
in the study of other diseases of the exocrine pancreas and salivary
glands.

Texto: In cystic fibrosis there is chronic infection and inflammatory
reaction in the airways, accompanied by destruction and shedding of
airway epithelium. Leukocytes migrate into the airways and some
disintegrate, liberating deoxyribonucleoprotein that is incorporated
into the gel structure of the bronchial mucus. We compared the status
of these processes in cystic fibrosis with that in chronic bronchitis
and bronchiectasis, by examining the sputum raised from the lower
airways. Measurements also were made on sputum induced in normal
subjects. The results indicate that migration of leukocytes into the
airways and shedding of damaged airway epithelium were minimal in the
normal subjects; they were significant in the patients with chronic
bronchitis, higher in those with bronchiectasis, and still higher in
those with cystic fibrosis. The large increases found in the total
content of DNA and solids in the cystic fibrosis sputum were due to
increases in the insoluble fraction containing the whole leukocytes
and particulate debris that remained when the sputum mucus gel was
solubilized with mercaptoethanol. Despite the large increases in the
total content of DNA and solids, the contents of mucus gel components
and of deoxyribonucleoprotein from disintegrated leukocytes actually
present in the mucus gel structure of the cystic fibrosis sputum were
not significantly higher than in the sputum from the patients with
chronic bronchitis or brochiectasis.

also observed in 23% of the children with CF. Uptake of lysine was
normal in CF patients whereas that of phenylalanine and cycloleucine

studied to evaluate the phychological impact of this chronic illness.
At first glance, most patients appeared to function adequately on a
daily basis. However, four sources of psychological stress, leading
to emotional disturbance, were identified: altered physical
appearance causing distorted body images and denial of sexuality,
strained interpersonal relationships resulting in isolation and
mental strain, conflicts in upbringing, and increased awareness of
the future and of death. Guidelines for the physician treating these
young adults and their families include: (1) encouragement for
greater involvement by the patient's father; (2) assisting the mother
to find outside interests and to allow more independence to the
patient; (3) stressing communication about cystic fibrosis within the
home; (4) emphasizing outside activity for each patient; (5) repeated
discussions of the patient's concerns while emphasizing his
strengths; (6) anticipation of problems, specific to cystic fibrosis,
such as sterility in males; and (7) encouragement of interpatient

transferral from another hospital.  Clinical discussion argues that
this child had acquired coagulopathy due to vitamin K deficiency and
that this was secondary to the fat malabsorption that occurs in
cystic fibrosis.  The left third nerve palsy and contralateral
hemiparesis in a patient with rapid neurologic deterioration suggest
a mass lesion in the left cerebral hemisphere with uncal herniation.
Pathologic discussion also suggests intracranial hemorrhage, massive
on left, accompanied by cystic fibrosis with severe pancreatic
lesions and bleeding disorder, probably due to vitamin K deficiency.

be carriers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. None of them, however, carried
P. aeruginosa in their nares. In contrast, none of the non-CF family
members of the patients with CF were carriers of P. aeruginosa. For
example, only 4 of 468 cultures from skin, throat, and nares of the
family members were positive for P. aeruginosa. Isolations of P.
aeruginosa from the same CF patients were often of the same pyocine
type. No specific pyocine type of P. aeruginosa was predominant in
patients with CF. Isolations of P. aeruginosa from siblings with CF
may or may not be of the same pyocine type as that of the family
proband. Colonization of a patient with CF by P. aeruginosa is not a
threat to the non-CF members of the family.

Texto: In our patient, the second child of a married couple heterozygous for
cystic fibrosis , the meconium protein content was higher than that
of controls.  He has no symptoms of cystic fibrosis.  The
determination of sodium and chloride ions in the sweat excluded
homozygosity; the bromide test led us to conclude the child to be a
heterozygote.  In our patient the protein content of the meconium,
the majority of which was albumin, was two- to threefold that of the
controls.  This elevated protein content, however, was not
characteristic of homozygosity.  Our results lead us to conclude that
a high protein content of meconium does not unconditionally indicate
the homozygotic state for cystic fibrosis.  It would appear that
heterozygosity for cystic fibrosis is not completely without
abnormality.  Our findings perhaps explain "false positive" results
recorded in the literature.  High-protein content in the meconium may
be useful in the identification of heterozygotes too.

There was an unusually high incidence of meconium ileus equivalent

One patient died at age four years after emotional problems

than a comparable, much larger group of white patients. Only one

pulmonary involvement as assessed by pulmonary function studies and
chest roentgenogram. The 16 surviving patients have a mean age of 13

cystic fibrosis in a black person over 20 years old.  Due in part to
the deficiency of pancreatic exocrine secretions and the production
of a copious amount of highly viscous mucus by gastrointestinal
glands, patients with cystic fibrosis are prone to recurrent
intestinal obstruction, intussusception, and volvulus, as well as
abdominal pain and masses.  Shwachman and Holsclaw firmly state that
the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis may be made on the histologic

with principal involvement only of the lungs. The absence of other
typical features of cystic fibrosis confused the diagnosis. Recovery
of mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa from sputum cultures helped to
establish the diagnosis in these patients, because these mucoid
isolates are rarely obtained from subjects who do not have cystic
fibrosis. Recent findings, which have identified the mucoid isolates
as predominantly a single strain of P aeruginosa and have documented
its widespread carriage in the United States by patients with cystic

Texto: The effects of serum from children with cystic fibrosis and from
normal children on the mucus-secreting, ciliated epithelium have been
investigated in vitro using explanted tissue from rabbit lung. By
optical and scanning electron microscopy, a sequence of structural
changes is observed after incubation with cystic fibrosis serum; this
sequence does not occur with normal serum. The earliest changes
involve swelling of the goblet cells, with subsequent discharge of
mucus onto the epithelial surface. This is followed by disruption of
the normally rapid and synchronized ciliary activity. Mucus gradually
extends over the surface entangling cilia. Finally, some shedding of
ciliated cells occurs from the epithelium. These findings suggest
that factors in cystic fibrosis serum cause discharge of mucus
leading to a disturbance of the normal ciliary activity in the rabbit
lung. It is postulated that such changes result in dysfunction of the
mucociliary clearance mechanism and that this dysfunction may be a
contributory factor to the pathogenesis of lung disease.

Texto: Screening for cystic fibrosis (C.F.) in the newborn has been in vogue
since the introduction of a rapid simple test based in the presence
of albumin in the meconium of C.F. babies.  False-positive tests have
been observed in prematurity or when the specimen is contaminated
with blood.  We have reduced the number of false positives by
additional studies on the meconium, including detection of lactase.
Lactase activity can be detected in meconium from babies with C.F.
but not in meconium for healthy babies.  In testing 200 normal
meconiums with a negative albumin test we noted 3 positive tests for
lactase.  These 3 patients did not have C.F.  These false-positive
lactase tests could be distinguished by the addition of distilled
water to the meconium instead of lactose.  This simple test may
provide an additional or alternative method for detection of C.F. in
a screening programme.  When this test is used in addition to the
albumin test the number of false-positive albumin tests will be
reduced.

Texto: Two reviews have questioned the value of meconium tests for the
routine screening of cystic fibrosis because of the high proportion
of false-positive and (perhaps more importantly) false-negative
results.  We wish to report our findings on false-negative results.
We are evaluating various methods of meconium screening including the
Boehringer Mannheim test strip, a semiquantitative test for proteins,
electroimmunoassay of albumin, and estimation of the
albumin/alpha1-antirypsin ratio.  The figures are too small to draw
any conclusions between the apparent relationship of false-negative
results and a family history of the disease, but we feel that the
results illustrate that little reliance should be put on a negative
meconium test.  This is not to say that the meconium test is
valueless.  In our study, at least 40% of infants with cystic
fibrosis had a positive meconium-test result but did not have
meconium ileus and thus the possibility of cystic fibrosis in these
infants was recognised within a few days after birth and usually well
before definitive clinical signs of the disease were manifest.

Texto: In an effort to determine whether increased permeability to calcium
ions could explain the cystic fibrosis-serum ciliary dyskensia factor
response in the tracheal test system, we selectively increased the
membrane permeability of the tracheal epithelium to calcium ions by
adding calcium ionophore A23187 to the tracheal culture medium.
These studies determined that calcium ionophore A23187 in culture
medium produced a change in mucociliary function in the tracheal test
system indistinguishable from that promoted by C.F. sera.  These
investigations, which are now being extended to include the
ultrastructural alterations induced in the epithelium of the rabbit
tracheal bioassay system, point to an important role for calcium as a
cofactor in the production of the C.D.F. response generated by the
C.F sera.  The C.F. serum substance seems to act at the
cellular-membrane level, promoting membrane-permeability changes (at
least with respect to calcium) in the rabbit tracheal test system.
Such a mechanism would not necessarily result in a net physiological
imbalance of calcium in the rabbit tracheal system but only local
changes in calcium concentration that would subsequently alter
secretion and microtubular function.  Since C.F. serum, like sweat
and saliva from these same patients, can promote ionic fluxes,
perhaps there is a common factor in all these body-fluids which is
related to the basic defect in C.F.  It is tempting to speculate that
such a factor produces a membrane-associated phenomenon that may be
generally representative of the in-vivo C.F. disorder and as such may
reflect the nature of the cellular and glandular abnormalities of the
disease.

to our understanding of the aetiology and pathogenesis of cystic

positive history of allergy, of which the mother and her maternal
progenitors, followed by the siblings, accounted for most.  Further
studies are required to establish the relationship, if any, between
the gene responsible for the allergic manifestation in the population

three headings: pulmonary disease, digestive disorders, and ion
transport abnormalities.  Research directions in cystic fibrosis have
evolved from observations of the characteristic malfunctions inherent
in the disease.  These include defects in mucociliary function,
mucous secretion, membrane transport and glycoprotein biosynthesis.
Drawing from what is known about the bases of other inherited
diseases, one could predict that cystic fibrosis results from an
abnormal functional protein, as in sickle cell anemia; an enzyme
deficiency, as in phenylketonuria; or a deficiency of a normal
inhibitor, as in hereditary angioedema.

Texto: The autosomal recessively inherited disorder cystic fibrosis is
clinically identified in patients by the pathognomonic finding of
increased electrolyte content in the exocrine secretion sweat.  Two
other observations merit mention.  First, the demonstration by Magos
of the existence of a factor in CF sweat which interfered with
reabsorption of sodium in the rat parotid.  Secondly is the existence
of a CF serum component which interfered with ciliary rhythm in organ
culture systems.  Our investigations in cystic fibrosis have been
oriented towards the establishment of a possible pedigree of causes
which will unite all these observations and secondly to develop a
possible method for heterozygote detection.  Cystic fibrosis RNA is
relatively undermethylated in comparison with contrast cultures.  In
addition, CF heterozygote fibroblast cultures also appear
undermethylated.  Our interpretation of these data do not imply a
primary defect of RNA methylases in cystic fibrosis but rather
suggested a defect elsewhere in biochemical sequences involving
methionine.

Measurement of intracellular cyclic AMP did not provide the same
clear-cut differences between the CF and control strains, as we had
previously observed.  The CF strains synthesized more cyclic AMP than
controls but the difference was not as large as in our earlier study
and there is considerable overlap between the two groups.  It is not
clear why these two studies should have yielded such disparate
results.

Texto: A biochemical study of bronchial mucins in sputum from patients with
cystic fibrosis was undertaken in order to determine their chemical
features and to compare them with bronchial mucins secreted in other
physiological or pathological conditions.  The mucins studied in the
present work were obtained from the insoluble and fibrillar part of
sputum.  If bronchial mucins are the main glycoproteins in the
fibrillar mucus, these data suggest that there is a high proportion
of acidic mucins within the bronchial secretions from CF patients.
The predominance of acidic mucins may not be a specific feature of CF
since the sputum from the 2 patients with other diseases had a
similar mucin distribution.  As far as CF is concerned, it is
presently impossible to state whether the bronchial mucins represent
normal mucins of the child or structurally abnormal molecules.

Texto: This paper reviews some of our efforts to compare mucous
glycoproteins from the tracheobronchial tract of cystic fibrosis
patients with those of control subjects.  We have used secretions
from several sources, including sputum, bronchial washings obtained
with the aid of the fiberoptic bronchoscope, tracheobronchial
aspirates through endotracheal or tracheostomy tubes and, finally,
secretions discharged by human tracheobronchial epithelial explants.
Solubilization and fractionation of secretions; properties of the
major mucous glycoprotein components; composition of major components
from non-infected, bronchitic and CF lungs; and organ culture of
human tracheobronchial epithelium are discussed.

Texto: Mucus is the primary aetiological factor in the development of
pulmonary disease in cystic fibrosis.  Biochemical studies on
bronchial secretions have not yet confirmed any qualitative
difference in composition or in the nature of the glycoproteins, the
major component of secretion.  With the lack of any clear evidence of
a basic abnormality in the nature of mucus, attention has been
directed to the possible defect in the control of mucus secretion.
This encompasses alteration in the normal regulation of the autonomic
nervous system or to its stimulation either at the cellular or
intracellular control level.  In recent years, attention has focused
on the presence of ciliotoxic factors in serum of children with
cystic fibrosis, and their possible role in the pathophysiology of
cystic fibrosis.  Control of mucus secretion, submucosal glands,
goblet cells, experimental models of lung disease in cystic fibrosis,
the role of serum factors in mucus secretion, and the mucus blanket
in chronic lung disease are discussed.

long been claimed to be the primary cause of pulmonary complications
- obstruction and infection - in patients suffering from cystic
fibrosis  (CF).  This review will draw in large measure on the
experience of Prof. L. Reid and her research team who over the last

Texto: Over the past few years, studies from various laboratories have
suggested the presence of a factor(s) in cystic fibrosis serum
causing widespread in vitro abnormalities of components of the lung
defence mechanism particularly with respect to macrophage
dysfunction, quantitative and qualitative alterations in mucus, and
ciliary motility.  The possible in vivo role of ciliary dysfunction
in the pathogenesis of the disease is of particular clinical
interest.  Since an in vitro ciliary dyskinesia factor had been
previously demonstrated and pulmonary complications are the hallmark
of CF, yet clearance in most of our clinically stable CF subjects was
relatively well maintained, this suggested to us that a mucociliary
transport abnormality might be present intermittently.  In order to
explore this further, we designed nasal mucociliary clearance studies
to determine whether CF serum might exhibit MCT inhibition in vivo.
From these studies, we concluded that there was a substance(s) in CF
serum which had the capacity to slow MCT.  Whether this effect is on
the cilia themselves or via overproduction of normal or abnormal
mucus is not known.
Recordnum: 00502
Texto: If we are to fully understand the factors which control mucociliary
clearance throughout the human lung and the interrelationships
between clearance and disease, it will be necessary to measure
mucociliary clearance rates in airways at all levels within the lung.
During the past few years, technical means have been sought whereby
the rates of mucus clearance within individual airways can be
measured.  In this laboratory, we have developed a relatively
noninvasive technique for measuring mucociliary tracheal transport
rates.  We measured MTTRs in 20 patients with cystic fibrosis.  The
MTTRs did not correlate well with the degree of pulmonary disease in
these patients.  The measurements of MTTR would suggest that a
deranged mucociliary clearance mechanism is not a necessary condition
for patients with CF.  We have also been interested in evaluating the
effectiveness of the therapy used in the treatment of CF.

Texto: This review describes the major directions in cystic fibrosis
research in the last nine years.  There have been no further reports
of cystic fibrosis in native African Negroes.  It has been generally
accepted that cystic fibrosis follows simple autosomal recessive
transmission.  It is difficult, however, to explain maintenance of a
lethal gene at such high frequency.  Nothing is known of the
chromosomal localization of the trait.  At present there is no simple
and reliable method of heterozygote detection.  The secretions of
patients with cystic fibrosis are often not copious but exhibit a
peculiar rheologic property.  Several groups have emphasized
decreased water content of cystic fibrosis secretions in the
pathogenesis of the disease.  There is no consistent abnormality of
glycoproteins or glycosaminoglycans to explain why mucus secretions
precipitate and obstruct the organ passages.

Texto: Tissue-culture studies involving metachromasia, glycosaminoglycans,
RNA methylation, cell membranes, and ciliatoxic activity in medium
are described.  Although not fulfilling the hopes of a quick route to
discovery of the basic defect in this disease that were raised by the
first findings, the study of fibroblasts in cystic fibrosis has given
important information.  The evidence at present indicates that
lysosomes and probably other intracellular organelles are normal in
morphology and function in cystic fibrosis.  Several humoral
abnormalities have been found in cystic fibrosis: those that
influence ciliary activity in experimental models; those that affect
membrane transport; and the abnormality in polyamine distribution.
A number of abnormal humoral factors have been found in cystic
fibrosis.  The limitations in their interpretation are serious: the
assays used to delineate these abnormalities are often not
universally reproducible, some because of their inherent variability
and others because they are technically forbidding.  Therefore,
unified definition of the so-called "cystic fibrosis factors" is not
possible at present.

Texto: Recent autonomic nervous system studies in cystic fibrosis are
outlined.  Miscellaneous observations regarding salivary and tear
glands, calcium, the kallikrein-kinin system, protease inhibitor,
alpha-fetoprotein, and endocrine glands are discussed.  Because more
than 90 per cent of patients with cystic fibrosis die of progressive
pulmonary involvement, complicated by infection with Staphylococcus
aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa (or both), the question of
immunologic deficit is frequently raised.  Extensive investigations
have shown the immune system in cystic fibrosis to be intact.
Studies regarding pulmonary ciliary clearance and bacteriology are
also outlined.  Despite extensive investigations, the basic defect of
cystic fibrosis is still unknown.  What then is the explanation of
the two defects in homozygotes that lead to most clinical
manifestations - the sweat electrolyte defect and the abnormality in
physiochemical behavior of mucous secretions?  The former is
satisfactorily explained by a sodium-reabsorption-inhibitory factor
present in sweat and saliva of patients.  As for the mucous-secretion
abnormality, the effect of the increasing calcium concentration in
decreasing the solubility of glycoproteins suggests that this
mechanism might be responsible for the precipitation and obstruction
of organ passages, which gives rise to most symptoms in cystic
fibrosis.  Although there is an excellent diagnostic test for
homozygotes (sweat test), one cannot rely on any of the present
biologic assays for determination of heterozygosity or antenatal
diagnosis.

Texto: Dysuria, uric acid crystalluria and hyperuricosuria developed in a
child with cystic fibrosis and normal serum uric acid.
Hyperuricosuria in this patient and two other children was directly
related to ingestion of large amounts of pancreatic extract. In these
three children, reducing pancreatic extract dosage by 85 percent
lowered their purine intake by 307, 225, and 148 mg, respectively;
urinary uric acid excretion decreased by 245, 239, and 158 mg.
Overmedication resulted from parents' decisions to increase enzyme
dosages. In our cystic fibrosis clinic, 15 of 32 patients screened at
random were taking higher than the prescribed dose of pancreatic
enzymes, and 14 of these 15 children were hyperuricosuric. On the
basis of this information, we suggest that the minimal effective dose
of pancreatic extract should be determined and adhered to for each
child with cystic fibrosis to avoid potential renal injury from
hyperuricosuria.

cystic fibrosis should be marred by a minor, yet unfortunately
common, error.  The risks of producing a child with cystic fibrosis
in Table 1 would have been essentially correct if they had been
stated in fractional terms.  They are, however, stated in odds forms,
and therefore understatements of the true risks.  The risk when both
parents are known to be heterozygous, for example, is stated as 1:4.
This would mean that the second alternative has four times as much
likelihood of occurring as the first, and it is clearly not true.
When both parents are heterozygous the odds are three times as likely
that the child will be normal as affected.  This is usually stated as
a risk of 1/4, or 1:3, that the child will be affected.

Texto: Our recent studies showed normal serum thyroxine but lower serum
total and free tri-iodothyronine and higher serum thyrotropin
concentration in children with cystic fibrosis than in controls
matched for age and sex.  Furthermore, administration of iodides to
children with cystic fibrosis resulted in goiter decrease in serum
thyroxine and increase in serum thyrotropin concentration.  Our
studies point to multiple derangement in thyroid hormone economy in
children with cystic fibrosis.  Peripheral deiodination of thyroxine
to tri-iodothyronine may be defective, probably as a result of a
state of malnutrition.  An intrinsic abnormality may also be present
in the thyroid gland.  Iodide, which is frequently used in this
disease, may enhance this defect, occasionally producing
hypothyroidism.  Therefore, the thyroid, like other organs of
endodermal origin (lung and pancreas), may be involved in cystic
fibrosis.  Thyroid function should be examined in all children with
cystic fibrosis, and if iodides are administered, replacement doses
of thyroid hormones should also be given to prevent hypothyroidism.
- A recent review of cystic fibrosis referred to the report by
Chandra et al. that the serum level of alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is
increased in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) or heterozygotes who
bear the CF gene.  The report of Chandra et al. had prompted us to
assess the level of AFP in cystic fibrosis, and we wish to record
here briefly our negative observations.  On the whole, these results
suggest that AFP is not increased in cystic fibrosis. - We thought
that the complications of therapy with iodides or other agents was
beyond the scope of our review, and thus we did not discuss the very
interesting observations of the high rate of goiter after iodide
therapy in CF patients.  Whether this phenomenon indicates a
subclinical thyroid defect related to CF per se or is a secondary
effect of chronic illness in youth is still unsettled.

Texto: One of the most important functions of the lung, aside from its role
in gas exchange and metabolism, is the provision of an essential

performed so efficiently that the lung is normally sterile from the
first bronchial division to terminal lung units.  Inhaled particles

Texto: The potential usefulness of analysis of the salivary secretions in
diagnosis and prognosis is beginning to be explored in depth. The
preliminary work already undertaken indicates that modern methods
applied to this secretion may provide information that is different
from that obtained in other body fluids. Saliva is collected at the
point of its manufacture and, therefore, is unaffected by collection
or storage in the body. It is the product both of protein synthesis
within the glands and of most of the known water and electrolyte
exchange mechanisms. Salivary composition is affected by both
autonomic and hormonal stimuli. As the specific influence of each of
these factors is better understood, studies of this fluid will
provide important clues to the understanding of disease and the
evaluation of therapy. There are few places in the body where it is
possible directly, utilizing a non-invasive technique, to examine the
product of a large number of important biological processes. It is
obvious that careful handling of collection and analytic techniques
are essential if these secretions are to be utilized. Future
investigations in clinical situations should take full advantage of
the strong base of knowledge of the physiology of these glands.
Development of this field depends on careful clinical investigations
designed to make full use of our current knowledge.

expected in chronically debilitated, immunosuppressed persons.  The
onset of an infectious disease in these patients can be sudden or
insidious with few prodromal signs.  Anorexia, malaise, fever, and
vomiting are nonspecific symptoms that these children may manifest
because of their primary illness or its treatment.  Any insult to
natural defense barriers may cause serious infections in the
compromised host.  An infected wound from an insect bite, easily
controlled by local measures in a healthy person, may become a focus

appropriate treatment of the specific infection, the
immunosuppressed person is still subject to overwhelming infection by
resistant opportunistic organisms until the natural defense
mechanisms are restored.  An awareness of the vulnerability of the

Texto: The early clinical recognition and assessment of cor pulmonale are
frequently difficult. To evaluate the usefulness of echocardiographic
measurement of right ventricular dimension and septal motion in
assessing cor pulmonale, we studied 94 patients with cystic fibrosis
of varying severity. There was a significant relationship between
increasing right ventricular dimension index (RVDI) and (1)
decreasing clinical score, vital capacity, forced expiratory volume
in one second (FEV1), and maximal midexpiratory flow rate (MMFR); and
(2) increasing residual volume and thoracic gas volume. There was no
correlation between right ventricular dimension index and PaO2. These
findings were supported by electrocardiogram and pathologic evidence
of right ventricular involvement. Abnormal septal motion was observed
more frequently in patients with severe obstructive airway disease as
measured by decreased vital capacity, FEV1, and MMFR. The data show
that there is echocardiographic evidence of mild right ventricular
enlargement and/or hypertrophy much earlier in the course of cystic
fibrosis than previously suspected and that the echocardiogram is a
useful tool in the evaluation of cor pulmonale in patients with

observations from this laboratory of an absence of a protease
component with arginine esterase activity in plasma of patients with
cystic fibrosis. In this study, the pooled plasma from control
individuals was activated and partially purified after adsorption on
columns of soybean trypsin inhibitor conjugated to Sepharose 4B
followed by elution with benzamidine. The fraction was further
purified by isoelectrofocusing on polyacrylamide gels. Proteins
around the pI range of 5.5 were eluted and utilized to prepare an
antiserum. Immunoelectrophoresis of activated plasma samples from
control subjects and patients with cystic fibrosis was performed
utilizing the antiserum. In controls, four precipitin arcs with
residual esterase activity were observed, whereas only three were
seen in plasma from patients with cystic fibrosis. Double gel
diffusion experiments using specific antisera ruled out the presence
of trypsin, chymotrypsin, plasminogen, prothrombin, C1 esterase,
alpha one-trypsin inhibitor, and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor in the
concentrated benzamidine eluate. The antisera to alpha two-
macroglobulin gave an immunoprecipitate which was readily stained for
proteolytic activity. On immunoelectrophoresis, the alpha two-
macroglobulin precipitin band corresponded to the band absent in
plasma of patients with cystic fibrosis. In contrast, the alpha two-
macroglobulin levels were similar in plasma of control subjects and
patients with cystic fibrosis. Using the antiserum to the protein
fractith proteolytic activity could be demonstrated in control
plasma. One specific enzyme-active "rocket" was absent in plasma of
patients with cystic fibrosis. In a double blind study of 15 control

"rocket" was shown to be present in 13 control samples and absent in
14 cystic fibrosis samples. alpha two-Macroglobulin was determined by
both an immunologic procedure and by its trypsin binding (trypsin
protein esterase concentration). The ratio of the immunologic assay

pancreatic disease the acini were further reduced to 5% and lobular
ducts to 37% of control levels, respectively. Main ducts increased by
19-fold, and fatty infiltration accounted for more than 25% of the
fresh weight of the pancreas in 9 of the 16 specimens. Comparative
biochemical studies of 35 fibrocystic pancreases were quantitatively
related to the severity of the pancreatic involvement as follows.
Water and volatile matter, normally accounting for 80 +/-% of the

calcium, amounting to over 10 times control level, were found in
obstructed ductal structures. Calcium was depleted from pancreatic
sections adjacent to the obstructions. The following biochemical

reflected in raised LDH and GPT might lead to raised GR as
demonstrated by positive correlations in controls.  The absence of a
positive correlation between these enzymes and GR in the CF sample as
well as normal values for LDH and GPT in CF suggests that the raised
serum GR in CF is not attributable to tissue leakage from damaged

appeared in increased amounts in parotid saliva samples containing
increased amounts of calcium. The 2 degree centrifuged pellet
consisted predominantly of protein, whereas the 37 degree pellet
contained calcium, inorganic phosphate, and protein. The cold-
dependent turbidity at 2 degrees was not inhibited by EDTA, but 37
degrees turbidity was dramatically inhibited. Urea and guanidine
hydrochloride reduced 2 degree turbidity, and, to a lesser extent,
inhibited 37 degree turbidity. The tendency towards higher levels of

between results of Thomas et al. and our own results on the one hand
and the previously reported results on the other.  We attempted to
rigorously reproduce the isoelectric focusing techniques given in the
literature.  However, isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel can
be affected by small technical differences and, thus, factors
essential to reproducing the techniques may not have been evident in
the published procedure.

Texto: A protein with an isoelectric point (pI) of 5.48 was found to be
deficient in plasma from most cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes and
obligate heterozygote carriers of CF as compared with normal control
plasma. Purification of the protein with a pI of 5.48 from normal
plasma was performed using ammonium sulfate precipitation, DEAE-
cellulose and CM-cellulose chromatography, Sephadex G-200- gel
filtration, starch block electrophoresis, and Sepharose 4B gel
filtration. The purified protein migrated as a single band on
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and displayed a single arc on
immunoelectrophoresis against polyvalent antiserum to whole human
serum. Results from various techniques used in its characterization
indicate that this protein is a fragment of alpha2-macroglobulin
(alpha2M) which is derived from alpha2M by proteolytic cleavage of
intact alpha2M subunits. Quantitation of alpha2M levels in plasma
indicated no significant differences between levels of alpha2M in CF
homozygote, obligate heterozygote carrier, or normal control plasma
samples. Quantitation of arginine esterase activity in plasma treated
with cloroform and ellagic acid indicated that both the total
arginine esterase activity and that fraction of arginine esterase
activity inhibited by soybean trypsin inhibitor (SBTI) were decreased
in most CF homozygote and obligate heterozygote plasma samples
relative to normal control values. The results of this study indicate
that plasma samples from CF homozygotes and obligate heterozygote
carriers for CF show deficient proteolytic cleavage of alpha2M as
compared with normal control plasma, and suggest that a structural
abnormality in alpha2M or a deficiency in plasma proteolytic activity
may be responsible for this deficiency in proteolysis.

Texto: High speed cinemicrographs are made on the ciliary activity of rabbit
tracheal cilia with the aid of Nomarski optics. The detailed nature
of the ciliary beat pattern is determined from slow motion analysis
of the high speed cinemicrographs (1-3). Such documented forms of
ciliary beat pattern and the physiologic state of the tracheal
epithelia are utilized as basic reference controls to investigate the
physiologic effects of cystic fibrosis serum on ciliated epithelia
and the cystic fibrosis tracheal mucus stagnation phenomenon. Careful
analyses of the high speed cinemicrographs reveal that cystic
fibrosis serum has no effect on the rhythm and beat pattern of rabbit
tracheal cilia. However, it is shown in controlled procedures that
cystic fibrosis serum has a cytolytic effect on the tracheal
epithelial cells and also at the cell junctions. Ciliary dyskinesis,
as described in previous reports (6-9), is actually a secondary
effect of cytolysis and cell destruction.

Texto: The purpose of this investigation was twofold: (1) to identify and
characterize the enzymatic ATP hydrolysis system of epithelial cilia,
and (2) to develop a quantitative, biochemical test for the
ciliotoxic cystic fibrosis (CF) factor based on inhibition of ATP
utilization by ciliary preparations. Our rationale for selecting this
system for CF factor analysis relates to the tight and essential
mechanochemical coupling of functioning cilia. Using rabbit tracheal
epithelium as the source, a high molecular weight (greater than
200,000) ATPase was identified, partially purified, and extensively
characterized. The properties of this protein were similar to those
observed in previous studies of others with flagellar and ciliary
dynein (the motility-associated ATPase) isolated from microorganisms.
Analysis of the pH profile revealed a broad range of high enzymatic
activity between 6.5 and 9. Studies with potential cation activators
showed that the enzyme is activated equally by either Ca2+ or Mg2+ in
equimolar concentrations. No activation occurred in the presence of
Zn2+, Na+, H+, or Na+ plus K+ and the effect of Mg2+ or Ca2+ was not
inhibited by Na+, K+, or Na+ plus K+. The enzyme hydrolyzed Mg2+-
containing solutions of UTP, CTP, and ADP at 51-54% the rate of ATP
dephosphorylation, whereas Mg-deoxy-ATP was hydrolyzed 79% as
effectively as ATP. Using a newly devised, analytical technique with
[gamma-32P]ATP as the substrate, the ATP hydrolysis of various
ciliary preparations from rabbit trachea and oyster gill (including
motile suspensions) was monitored in the presence of sera from CF
homo- and heterozygotes. Reproducible rates of ATP dephosphorylation
averaging 27 nmol/min/mg protein were demonstrable with homogenates
of ciliated epithelium. None of the test systems evaluated, however,
were capable of demonstrating CF-related differences in ATPase
activity or ATP utilization. Although these attemps have been
unsuccessful thus far, the approach described in this report provides
an example of an objective, quantitative, biochemical assessment of
ciliary function.

Texto: A major feature of the disease cystic fibrosis is the excessive
concentration of mucus within ducts and glands of mucous-producing
organs. Some mucous secretions also show an elevation in calcium
concentration. Using purified rat intestinal goblet cell mucin as a
model mucin, we have investigated the effect of millimolar additions
(1-25 mM) of CaCl2 on the physical properties of the mucin.
Isotonicity of incubation media was preserved in order to mimic in
vivo conditions. CaCl2 (8-15mM) caused a 15-33% decrease in
viscosity, no change in electrophoretic mobility in acrylamide gels,
and a 20-30% decrease in solubility of the mucin. Solubility changes
were reversed by the addition of EDTA (20 mM) to incubations.
Insolubility was also produced in incubations of mucin with a mixture
of soluble intestinal contents (NaCl washings). These findings
strongly suggest that the mucin became smaller and more dense as
calcium was added, a process most probably achieved by loss of
intramolecular water.

Texto: Detection of cystic fibrosis protein (CFP) using out method involves
rather exacting requirements for the collection of serum samples and
their subsequent analysis by electrofocusing.  Minor variations in
the methods described for sample collection and storage may cause
degradation and loss of CFP and this by itself could lead to
erroneous results since many CF samples would appear to be CFP
negative, making it impossible to observe a consistent difference
between a group of CF samples and normal control samples by
electrofocusing.  From the results presented by Thomas et al. and
Figure 1 of the letter by Smith et al., it is obvious that neither
group has reproduced the protein handling patterns presented in
either of our previous reports.  The pH gradients are not the same,
the location of the sample pads relative to the anode are not the
same, and the protein banding patterns are totally different.  We
question the validity of the techniques used, claims of having
reproduced our method for detecting CFP, or supposed improvements
designed to enhance the detection of CFP.

Texto: The ciliostatic cystic fibrosis (CF) factor has been investigated in
order to develop an enzymatic assay for its detection. In saliva,
this factor is associated with alpha-amylase. Removal or addition of
the factor by dialysis does not affect the alpha-amylase catalytic
activity of CF or control (normal) saliva. Crude preparations of the
dialyzable factor from CF saliva are ciliostatic. Alpha-Amylase-
catalyzed starch hydrolysis from both CF and control saliva was found
to be insensitive to hydroxyalkylamine inhibitors so this method
could not be used to detect differences in CF and control amylase.
Since another carbohydrase, mammalian debranching enzyme, is much
more sensitive to inhibition, the effect of the isolated crude factor
on this enzyme was determined. The mean values for percentage of
inhibition of debranching enzyme activity by fractions obtained from
saliva of CF patients, obligate heterozygotes, and control subjects
are: 32% (27 samples), 13% (21 samples), and 6% (11 samples),
respectively. Fifteen of the CF values exceed the maximum 13%
inhibition observed for controls. Indeed, five samples almost
completely inhibited debranching enzyme. This inhibitory action
provides the basis of an enzymatic assay for the detection of the
ciliostatic CF factor.

recovered in the lung lavage fluid with a 233% increase in the
absolute and relative amounts of a low molecular weight glycoprotein

toward etiology, pathophysiology, and therapy in patients with cystic
fibrosis.  As in Elliott's original report of the effects of
intravenous fatty acid therapy for CF, the patients in the present
report fared remarkably well, particularly in regard to weight gain.
The paper of Campbell et al. suggests that oxygen does not simply
diffuse across membranes, but that instead its transport is
influenced by the fatty acid composition of the membrane.  Elliott's
suggestion that the disarranged fatty acid metabolism may be related
to altered prostaglandin production is attractive.  These studies do
not prove whether fatty acid and/or prostaglandin alterations are
secondary to intestinal fat malabsorption or are related to the
primary metabolic defect in CF.

Texto: Impaired oxygen supply and deteriorating health, in cystic fibrosis
patients, correlates with abnormal changes in the fatty acid
composition of blood lipids. As the proportion of oleates increases
and that of linoleates decreases, erythrocyte membrane interference
with the formation of intracellular oxyhemoglobin increases and
arterial oxygen pressure decreases. The physical-chemical basis for
these changes seems to be that oleic and linoleic acid differ in
their ability to undergo reversible oxygenation in response to
changes in oxygen pressure. The oxygen complex of linoleic acid
dissociates at relatively high pressures, whereas that of oleic
dissociates only at low pressures. Accordingly, excessive
substitution of oleic for linoleic acid in membrane lipids would be
expected to decrease the intracellular oxygen pressure to a level
where hemoglobin oxygenation and any other oxygen-requiring processes
would be impaired.

Texto: Two patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) who subsequently developed
celiac disease (CD) are described. Since organ culture of intestinal
mucosa has been used to establish an in vitro model for the study of
CD, we utilized this opportunity to determine whether duodenal mucosa
obtained from each of these two patients and their immediate families
differed in its organ culture behavior from mucosa obtained from
patients with CD alone. Additionally, as specific HL-A types are
associated with CD, we used HL-A typing to determine whether the two
patients with CF-CD differed genetically from patients with CD alone.
One of our patients was HL-A8, the most common type associated with
CD; the other was HL-A12, as are many of the non-HL-A8 celiac
patients. The response in organ culture of the mucosa of these two
patients was the same as the response in organ culture of the mucosa
from patients with CD alone. These and other data suggest that CD
occurring in patients with CF is no different than CD occurring
alone.

Texto: With regard to the recent study of Dietzsch et al. on the use of
arginine hydrochloride inhalation in cystic fibrosis patients, I wish
to point out that these investigators acted irresponsibly in exposing
their patients for an appreciable period (seven weeks) to a
preparation which is known to be irritating.  I would suggest that
the deleterious effects seen by Dietzsch et al. are due to their
inattention to experimental detail and lack of communication with
other investigators. - Dietzsch et al. give the impression in their
article that all arginine solution are detrimental to the lung.  We
wish to point out that L-arginine hydrochloride buffered with a
sodium solution is irritative to the airway of cystic fibrosis
patients.  However, no comparison studies were done with L-arginine
buffered with free base. - The fate of these children with cystic
fibrosis depends on the quality of the inhalation treatment.  This
means if you replace a good mucolytic drug with a better one you step
by step approach the ideal mucolytic solution.  We think it to be
unethical to use other, less effective, drugs or solutions in a
control group (e.g., saline or distilled water).  We did not state
that arginine solutions are "irritative" or that arginine treatment
is "dangerous."  The N-acetylcysteine solution, which was
successfully used before the treatment of our patients, was buffered
with sodium hydroxide to a pH of 7.0.  The quantity of sodium which
was administered during each inhalation amounts to only 0.04 mval of
sodium so that an injurious pharmacological effect can be excluded.
Both drugs were well tolerated and had no "deleterious" effects.

theophylline on pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis (CF) to
determine how often these drugs are beneficial and whether there is a
correlation between response to isoproterenol and response to oral
theophylline. After obtaining baseline pulmonary function tests
before and after isoproterenol aerosol, 12 patients with CF were put
on a double-blind trial of high-dosage theophylline (10 mg/kg three
times per day) or placebo for four weeks and were then switched to
the alternate regimen for the next four weeks. Patients had weekly
evaluations of pulmonary function and plasma theophylline
determinations. Gastrointestinal side effects were common with
theophylline. The responses to aerosolized bronchodilators were
inconsistent from week to week. After aerosolized bronchodilator,
five of 12 patients had an average increase of 10% or more in FEF45%-
55% and FEF70%-80%. While taking oral theophylline, five patients had
a 10% or more decrease in FEF 45%-55% and six patients had a decrease
in FEF70%-80%. We conclude that there was no concordance between
response to isoproterenol and theophylline, and that adrenergic and
methylxanthine drugs must be used with caution in patients with CF.

Texto: To determine if the abnormalities of exocrine secretion
characteristic of cystic fibrosis could be investigated in vitro, I
studied the synthesis of 3':5'-cyclic AMP after isoproterenol
stimulation in skin fibroblasts derived from patients with cystic
fibrosis and from normal individuals. Comparison of normal and cystic
fibrosis cells showed that the latter had 2- to 5-fold greater levels
of intracellular cyclic AMP after stimulation with isoproterenol. The
difference between the strains was observed at every stage of the
culture cycle and was specific to stimulation by beta-adrenergic
agonists. It could not be accounted for by different dose- or time-
response curves nor by leakage of cyclic AMP into the medium. The
increased sensitivity to catecholamines may reflect an intrinsic
genetic property of cystic fibrosis cells, and it may be feasible to
use this system to study the biochemical basis of the genetic defect
in cystic fibrosis.

Staphylococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Pseudomonas

pediatric hospitals.  With changes and advances in treatment,
patients who were once considered terminally ill are now living into
adulthood.  The stresses that result from chronic illness are
considered herein from the standpoint of the social caseworker, who
plans a crucial role on the patient-care team.  New problems
regarding the personal development of the patient are presented,
with particular emphasis on the role of a CF patient as a parent.
The role of the respiratory therapist in the care of such patients
is unique.  This is due to the extensiveness of patient contact,
both verbal and physical, and to the primary threat that pulmonary
disease poses to the patient with CF.  The therapist's ability to
cope with the problem, while aiding the family and patient to do the
same, becomes crucial to the child's rehabilitation.  The
requirements for fulfilling this role are educational and
developmental in nature, and should be pursued as a model for future
patient care.

radioimmunoassay in blood from cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes,
heterozygote carriers of CF, normal healthy controls, and other
patient controls with carcinomas involving gastrointestinal organs.
All samples were also screened by electrofocusing for cystic fibrosis
protein (CFP), a metabolic marker previously shown to be associated
with the CF gene. Significantly increased levels of CEA activity were
found in all CFP-positive groups; however, with one exception all
patient controls with marked increases in CEA activity were CFP-
negative. Immunodiffusion of perchloric acid extracts of CEA-like
material from heterozygote carrier blood indicated that the CEA-like
material, which was elevated in homozygotes and heterozygotes for CF,
showed only partial identity with two separate CEA preparations
obtained from colon carcinomas and was not identical to either A, B,
or O(H) blood group substances. This glycoprotein material did,
however, react with three different anti-CEA antisera. Our finding of
an abnormally increased glycoprotein in cystic fibrosis, taken
together with previous reports demonstrating abnormalities in the
carbohydrate portion of glycoproteins found in various  exocrine
secretions in CF, further suggests that the primary defect in this
disease is manifested partly as a defect in glycoprotein metabolism.
This defect may result from an abnormality in one or more of the
glycosyltransferases, possibly caused by a more primary defect in
polyamine metabolism.

children with cystic fibrosis and other chronic diseases indicate
that marital breakdown is no more prevalent among these couples than

the divorce rate is lower than the United States national average.
For parents of children with cystic fibrosis, the divorce rate is

We speculate that the inability to plan more children may be the
factor responsible for the higher prevalence among these parents

Texto: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a recessive autosomal genetic disease in
which exocrine glands secrete highly viscous mucus.  Variable genetic
penetrance ("organ sparing") results in a broad spectrum of clinical
presentations.  The diagnosis of CF is usually established by the
presence of chronic obstructive lung disease and/or gastrointestinal
dysfunction, together with elevated levels of sweat electrolytes
(chloride > 60 mEq/liter), markedly diminished duodenal pancreatic
enzyme concentrations, or pathologic changes in tissue.  Family
history may occasionally be helpful.  The metabolic basis of CF is
unknown.  The classic stereotype of the CF patient is an infant with
a chronic cough, diarrhea, and growth failure.  Improved medical care
is enabling many of these patients to reach adulthood, and increased
diagnostic suspicion is resulting in identification of the disease in
more adults.  Based upon analysis of over 11,000 cases of CF reported
during the year 1974 by 119 Cystic Fibrosis Centers, the National
Cystic Fibrosis Foundation estimated that the probability of an
individual with CF surviving to age 20 was approximately 39%.
Although most of these adults are currently under the care of
pediatricians, the development of medical, psychiatric, surgical, or
obstetric complications may necessitate the involvement of other
professionals.  A joint study of cystic fibrosis in adults conducted
by Duke Medical Center and the NIH has shown that the majority of
affected adults, including those diagnosed early in life, are married
and work full- or part-time.  Many manifest few if any symptoms until
relatively late in life.  Since this study was retrospective, the
reported frequencies of the clinical findings tend to underestimate,
in all instances, the actual incidence in the population studied.
The reported incidence of CF in the United States has been
conservatively estimated at 1:2,000 live births.  If all adults with
clubbing, infertility, and other symptoms were evaluated for CF, the
true incidence would certainly be higher.

the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene on the active uptake of 3-0-14C-methyl-
D-glucose (3-0-14C-MDG) by rat jejunal epithelium was studied.
Furthermore, the role of the polyamine, spermidine, and its products
of metabolic degradation on glucose transport were investigated, and
a relationship to the pathogenesis of membrane dysfunction in cystic
fibrosis was postulated. Glucose transport in everted rat jejunal
rings was used in the study. Results were expressed as 3-0-14C-MDG
concentration ratio between the intracellular (ICF) and the
extracellular fluid spaces (ECF) of the jejunal rings at the end of a
60 min incubation period. The mean ratio obtained from incubations of
the rat jejunal rings in medium consisting of Krebs-Ringer-
bicarbonate buffer and the labeled sugar was considered as 100%
uptake. When plasma or serum, with or without spermidine, was mixed
with the medium in a volume ratio of 1:3, a decrease in the active
uptake of 3-0-14C-MDG was observed, expressed as percent inhibition.
Percent inhibition of 3-0-14C-MDG uptake obtained when the rat
jejunal rings were incubated in normal plasma was compared to that
obtained with plasma from cystic fibrosis genotypes. It was found
that: 1) plasma from 25 homozygous children had greater inhibitory
effect on glucose uptake than plasma from 26 normal children; 2)
plasma from 9 heterozygous women had greater inhibitory effect than
that from 6 normal women; 3) the inhibitory effect of plasma from 3
homozygous children was not influenced by dialysis; 4) the inhibitory
effects of paired plasma and serum samples from 9 homozygotes were
comparable; 5) spermidine added to the incubating electrolyte
solution did not affect glucose transport; 6) the addition of
spermidine to reaction mixtures containing normal plasma potentiated
the inhibitory effect; and 7) mixing and incubation of fresh bovine
serum with reaction mixtures containing plasma from homozygotes
decreased the inhibitory effect. The predominant inhibitory effect of
plasma or serum from homozygotes and heterozygotes for the CF gene
appears to be related to a nondialyzeable molecule(s). It does not
seem to reflect the presence of high plasma glucose levels in cystic
fibrosis nor to be the result of competitive inhibition between
sugars. It does not seem to be the result of sodium or other
electrolyte differences. A similar inhibitory effect is acquired by
normal plasma after the addition of spermidine. On the other hand,
plasma from CF homozygotes loses its inhibitory effect after
incubation with fresh bovine serum. These findings may indicate that
products of metabolic degradation of spermidine are responsible for
the inhibitory effect of glucose transport and suggest the
possibility of a role in abnormal polyamine metabolism in the
pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis.

Texto: Ultrastructural analysis including scanning and transmission electron
microscopic studies (SEM and TEM) were carried out on oyster gill
tissue after exposure either to serum fractions from individuals
homozygous or heterozygous for cystic fibrosis (CF), to comparable
serum fractions from normal individuals, or to sea water. In 4 of the
experiments examined topologically (SEM), the CF sera (either
heterozygous or homozygous) stimulated the production of mucus that
was found in close association with the cilia. The association of
excessive mucus with the cell surface could be responsible, in part,
for the well-known inhibition of ciliary activity by a factor in CF
serum. In 3 additional SEM experiments involving shorter treatment
times, very little difference could be observed between homozygous
CF, heterozygous CF, and normal serum-fraction-treated oyster
tissues. In parallel experiments, ultrathin sections of gill tissue
were examined by means of TEM. Those samples that were responsive, as
determined by TEM, displayed several characteristic features,
including enlarged and partially exuded goblet cells, altered mucus
structure along with twisted and matted cilia. An overall swelling of
the gill filament was also observed in the responsive tissues. From
TEM analysis no detectable alteration in fine structure was apparent
in gill tissues that were treated with sera from heterozygous or
normal individuals.

Texto: The cystic fibrosis ciliary inhibitor (CFCI) has been partially
purified from serum and plasma of cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes
and heterozygotes, and from media of cultured fibroblasts derived
from cystic fibrosis genotypes. Characterization and comparison of
fractions containing the CFCI were carried out by polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis. Gel electrophoresis confirmed previous molecular
weight estimations of 4,500 to 11,000 for the CFCI and provided an
estimate of the number of proteins present in the fractions. Low
molecular weight proteins from serum and media were combined with IgG
preparations. No specific binding to IgG by the media fraction
containing the CFCI could be demonstrated by the techniques employed.
There was decreased binding of the low molecular weight serum
fraction containing CFCI to native IgG molecules from cystic fibrosis
patients as compared to IgG from normal individuals. However, IgG
from CF individuals demonstrated increased binding of the cfci-
containing low molecular weight serum fraction after gel filtration
in the presence of guanidinium chloride. This suggests: 1) that very
low concentrations of CFCI are present in media fractions; and 2)
that native CF IgG cannot bind the low molecular weight CFCI
fractions to the same degree as native IgG from normals or CF IgG
that has been dissociated from non-covalently bound components.

Texto: Fibroblasts derived from cystic fibrosis homozygotes and
heterozygotes were compared to normal fibroblasts topologically,
ultrastructurally, and microchemically. Topological examinations, by
means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed no significant
differences between the 3 genotypes surveyed. The cells were
generally flattened and/or fusiform structures that were more or less
devoid of surface details. However, the dividing cells, in all of the
populations surveyed, were found to have a more or less spherical
configuration involving a highly complicated surface. The surface
manifestations included blebs, ridges, and microvilli. Representative
samples of the cells in all stages of growth, lag phase, exponential
phase, and plateau phase, were surveyed in this study.
Ultrastructurally, the fibroblasts of the 3 genotypes were found to
have similar cytological detail. Highly infolded nuclei, distinct
organelle components, and surface details, also seen in the SEM
study, were observed. Numerous bundles of microfilaments were noted
within the cytoplasm. Metachromatic granules were observed in cells
from all 3 genotypes. Microchemical analysis, by means of energy
dispersive X-ray analysis, demonstrated slight but recognizable
differences in the elemental composition of the 3 genotypes. Of
notable interest were the peak intensities of calcium and sulfur. The
CF homozygous cells presented higher values for both of the elements
when compared to the values observed in the CF heterozygous and
normal cell populations. Although consistent differences could be
observed in the CF genotypes when compared to the non-CF cells, no
attempt was made to quantitate the concentrations of each of the
elements within the cells.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a common inherited disorder which is
characterized by the production of exocrine secretions with elevated
ion content and abnormally viscous mucus. Over the last few years
cells obtained from the peripheral blood or cultured from tissues of
cystic fibrosis patients have been used increasingly in the study of
the disease. Investigations of the following properties of cystic
fibrosis cells are reviewed: morphology, ultrastructure, growth
kinetics, cellular metachromasia, the production of ciliary
inhibitors, cellular composition, plasma membrane composition, the
transport of inorganic ions and small organic molecules, lysosomal
enzyme content, and RNA methylation. Studies of the effects on
cultured cells and erythrocyte membranes of factors in CF cell
culture medium and biological fluids from CF patients are discussed.

Hybrids were produced by the fusion of cultured skin fibroblasts from

primary hybrid clones but not detected in others, indicating the

Texto: Recent research in cystic fibrosis has suggested at least two
theories regarding the genetic defect underlying this prevalent
disease: that a mutant gene in cystic fibrosis genotypes is
responsible for the synthesis of an altered protein that interferes
with membrane transport and mucociliary activity; and that a mutant
gene in cystic fibrosis genotypes is responsible for an enzyme
deficiency leading to the presence of undegraded metabolites that
interfere with membrane transport.  Circulating factors in cystic
fibrosis and their effects on membrane transport and mucociliary
systems are discussed, as are the search for an enzymatic deficiency
and investigations of altered metabolic pathways.  Comparison of
somatic cells from cystic fibrosis and normal genotypes is also
outlined.

Texto: One of the most consistent characteristics of cystic fibrosis is the
abnormal handling of electrolytes by exocrine glands. The present
study has examined the possibility that diminished respiratory energy
formation is a primary biochemical error responsible for this
abnormality. Using oxygen consumption of intact larval brine shrimp,
quantitative differences have been observed from reaction of mixed
mouth saliva between CF heterozygotes and CF homozygotes. In
addition, information demonstrating a correlation between a
biochemical abnormality and disease severity was observed. The
differences observed in inhibition by saliva from both CF homozygotes
and obligate heterozygotes may occur as the result of 1) interference
with electron transfer from organic fuel molecules to molecular
oxygen or 2) interference with the mechanism responsible for
generating the biochemical reducing power necessary for multiple
biosynthetic reactions.

Texto: Sera and lymphocyte culture media derived from cystic fibrosis (CF)-
affected and carrier subjects contain ciliary dyskinesia factor (CDF)
detected by our rabbit tracheal bioassay. In addition, we also find
CDF in fibroblast media from these same donors and in amniotic fluid
cell media derived from CF carrier or affected fetuses. In these
latter instances, the media were inactive in the bioassay, but became
active when mixed with purified IgG. In all instances, CDF activity
was eliminated by the addition of anti-IgG. We have separated a low
molecular weight fraction, between 1,000 and 10,000 M.W., from CF
sera and culture media which is inactive in the bioassay until IgG is
added. Presumptive and indirect evidence indicates that this fraction
behaves similarly to the complement derived anaphylatoxin C3a. In
addition, we have found activity in sera from CF patients and, to a
lesser extent, carriers that induces degranulation of cytochalasin-B-
treated human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Since this activity
appears to be in a different molecular species from that containing
CDF, we postulate that the primary defect in CF is the deficiency of
an enzyme whose substrates include a family of membrane-active
molecules.

Texto: Sera from cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes and obligate heterozygotes
contain a CF factor (gamma CF factor) not found by isoelectric
focusing in thin-layer polyacrylamide gels in most normal control
sera. In addition, sera from most obligate heterozygotes lack another
protein (bland B, C, or D) that is commonly found in sera from most
normal and cystic fibrosis individuals. A standardized, biophysical
assay is described that employs isoelectric focusing for the
detection of both CF homozygotes and heterozygotes based on the
analysis of whole serum for the presence of the gamma CF factor and
bands B, C, and D. Results of analyzing sera from selected CF
patients by isoelectric focusing indicated that there is a general
correlation between the amount of the gamma CF factor and the
clinical severity of the disease. Partial purification and
characterization of the gamma CF factor and protein bands B, C,  and
D was accomplished by using DEAE-cellulose chromatography, Sephadex G-
200 gel filtration, sequential molecular filtration through a series
of Amicon Diaflo ultrafiltration membranes, affinity chromatography,
and cellulose acetate electrophoresis. The gamma CF factor is a
cationic protein with a pI of 8.46+/-0.05, has gamma electrophoretic
mobility, a molecular weight between 3,500 and 10,000, and apparently
exists in CF serum in 2 forms (free in solution and complexed to
IgG). Bands B, C, and D are cationic proteins with pI values of 7.85
to 8.10, have gamma electrophoretic mobility and a molecular weight
of approximately 100,000-150,000.

Texto: The cystic fibrosis ciliary inhibitor (CFCI) has been fractionated
from plasma of cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes and from the media of
cultured fibroblasts derived from CF homozygotes. Plasma and
fibroblast media from normal controls have been fractionated in an
identical manner. Fractions from plasma and fibroblast culture media
that demonstrate ciliary inhibitory activity contain several proteins
in a molecular weight range of approximately 5,000-11,000. These
proteins have been partially characterized by immunochemical analysis
with antisera to 33 human serum proteins. Immunological determinants
of albumin, C3 (but not C3a), C4, C5, alpha1-lipoprotein, beta-
lipoprotein, beta2-microglobulin and immunoglobulin light chains have
been detected by hemagglutination in fractions of CF plasma that
inhibited ciliary activity and in analogous fractions from normal
sera. None of the proteins were detected in media of cultured
fibroblasts from either genotype. Since the same proteins and protein
fragments were identified in both CF and normal plasma fractions, and
were not detected in CF fibroblast media, it appears that none of
these proteins can be identified as the CFCI. Identification of these
proteins will permit further purification of the CFCI by
immunochemical methods.

Texto: Membrane function was examined in cultured cells from cystic fibrosis
patients by assaying several enzymes on intact skin fibroblasts
attached to culture dishes. This technique required few cells and
minimized disruption of cellular organization. Comparison of enzyme
activities of intact and broken cells showed that 12% of total
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, a cytoplasmic enzyme, was
measurable using intact cells, while all adenosine monophosphatase
was measurable using intact cells. Alkaline
paranitrophenylphosphatase activity was divided between the cell
surface and interior. Substrate competition experiments indicated
that substrate specificities for adenosine monophosphatase and
paranitrophenylphosphatase activities were different. Adenosine
monophosphatase activities of 2 control and 2 cystic fibrosis strains
fluctuated similarly during the cell culture cycle. The apparent Km
values relative to adenosine monophosphate were similar in all
strains. A chromatographic fraction of serum from a cystic fibrosis
patient that was inhibitory to oyster ciliary activity had no effect
on adenosine monophosphatase activity of normal fibroblasts.
Furthermore, fractions of media from cystic fibrosis homozygote and
heterozygote fibroblast cultures were not inhibitory to adenosine
monophosphatase activities of intact normal fibroblasts or of part
iculate fractions prepared from them. In light of previous studies
that showed that factors from cystic fibrosis serum of culture medium
disrupted specific membrane activities, it is proposed that the
cystic fibrosis factor interacts with the plasma membrane,
interfering most conspicuously with the protein functions that are
sensitive to changes in their membrane environment.

cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes, CF heterozygotes and normal

with time in culture, and no difference was observed between the 3
genotypes tested. The cell cycle times remained constant through the
10th subculture, while the growth fraction, or fraction of cells in
the cell cycle, decreased with culture time; however, changes in the
growth fraction and population doubling time appear to be related to
cellular senescence in vitro rather than to cystic fibrosis.

Texto: Immunoglobulin levels and precipitating antibody against a range of
microbial antigens were measured in simultaneously collected serum
and sputum samples from patients with chronic bronchitis (11), cystic
fibrosis (9), bronchiectasis (9), and asthma (4). Sputum was prepared
by dialysis and high-speed centrifugation methods. Results showed
that it was possible to detect precipitating antibody in the sputum,
and the rate was increased when both methods were used. A discrepancy
was noted between the detection rate in the sputum and serum. This,
combined with the lack of correlation between sputum and serum
immunoglobulins, lack of relationship between bronchial inflammation
and sputum immunoglobulins, and the lack of IgM in the sputum
suggested that the antibody and immunoglobulin were locally produced.
Sputum IgA (7S) in patients with chronic bronchitis was significantly
lower (P less than 0-05) than that found in patients with cystic
fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Significant differences (P less than 0-
05) were also noted in serum IgG levels between patients with chronic
bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and cystic fibrosis while serum IgM
levels in patients with chronic bronchitis were significantly lower
(P less than 0-05) when compared to serum levels in patients with
cystic fibrosis. The presence of precipitating antibody in the sputum
raises the possibility that type III reactions may be important in
the pathogenesis of these conditions.

increase in this measurement with height, weight, and end-inspiratory

children using the Bohr equation and substituting a rebreathing PCO2
for alveolar PCO2. There was a parallel increase in this measurement
with height, weight, and end-inspiratory lung volume. The difference
between the two dead space measurements constitutes the alveolar dead
space and was constant over the whole age range at 45 +/- 22 ml. The
ratio of physiological dead space to tidal volume was 33-6 +/-4-6%
and was unaltered by age or change in lung volume. The effect of
airways obstruction on the dead space volumes was studied in 36
children with asthma and 28 with cystic fibrosis. Physiological dead
space increased with increasing airways obstruction. Anatomical dead
space remained constant in spite of marked increases in lung volume
associated with the airways obstruction.

Texto: A simple method has been elaborated for the routine separation and
quantitative determination of amylase isoenzymes. The ratio P/S, the
quotient of the activity values obtained by densitometric evaluation
of the pancreatic and salivary isoenzymes, is used to characterize
their distribution. In healthy adults and children the value for P/S
is above 1 in 80% of the cases, with a mean of 1.87 +/- 0.23. In 90%
of heterozygote CF gene-carriers, the P/S is below 1 with a mean of
0.68 +/- 0.13. In addition to the higher total amylase activity, in
MV homozygote patients P/S is less than 0.1, and even 0.001. The
phenomenon is explained by a compensatory enhancement of salivary
activity. The method is a suitable diagnostic test of the exocrine
function of the pancreas and for evaluation of the serum amylase
isoenzymes. The P/S value allows to differentiate heterozygote CF
gene-carriers from homozygotes and healthy individuals.

Texto: The glucagon and insulin responses to intravenous arginine were
studied in 17 children with cystic fibrosis and in 9 control
children. It was found that the overall secretion of insulin was
diminished; however, four of the CF children did have a normal
output. The glucagon responses did not parallel those of insulin. The
glucagon output varied in the CF children--seven had normal, four
excessively high and six low output. Three of the four children with
extremely high output had more severe disease and were below the
third centile on the weight chart. These four had a fasting
hypoglycaemia and also a very low glucose and insulin response. We
have confirmed diminished insulin secretion in cystic fibrosis, but
diminished glucagon secretion was only noted when some insulin
secretion was preserved. The high levels of glucagon seen in the most
insulin deficient subjects may be derived from extrapancreatic
sources, or may be associated with 'stress' reaction in these
patients who also had most severe pulmonary involvement. The data
would be consistent with diminished glucagon and insulin secretion
from the pancreas but as the disease progresses an excessive
secretion of extra pancreatic glucagon results.

examined by echocardiography. Right ventricular dimension (RVD) was
above upper normal limit in 14 patients and right ventricular
dimension index (RVD index) was higher than the upper normal limit in
11 patients. Furthermore, there was a significant relationship
between increasing RVD index and 1) decreasing forced vital capacity
(FVC) both actual test results and average 6 months values; and 2)
decreasing peak-expiratory flow rate (PEFR) both actual test results
and average 6 months values. This observation suggests a persistent
heart involvement. Five patients had either heart failure and/or
electrocardiographic evidence of right ventricular abnormality. These
patients had increased RVD index and one patient with the highest RVD
index died 8 weeks after the examination. The present study has shown
the usefulness of echocardiographic measurement of right ventricular
dimension and of septal motion in assessing cor pulmonale, before
development of electrocardiographic abnormalities and right heart
failure.

mucoid P. aeruginosa and ten patients without P. aeruginosa infection
were examined for occurrence of circulating immune complexes, for
immune complex deposits in the dermo-epidermal junction of the skin

orosomucoid, immunoglobulins, C1q, C3, C4 and total haemolytic
complement, antinuclear and rheumatoid factor activities as well as
white blood cell counts and erythrocyte sedimentation rates were
determined also. The results indicated that 6 patients from the
chronically P. aeruginosa infected group, exhibiting a spectrum of
serum precipitins against P. aeruginosa antigens, also had immune
complexes in the serum, while only one patient (suffering from
selective IgA deficiency) in the group without P. aeruginosa
infection was positive for soluble immune complexes. Granular
deposits of IgM was found in the skin of 10 of the chronically P.
aeruginosa infected patients and in 7 of the patients without P.

from CF patients were more sensitive than strains from non-CF
patients to the bactericidal activity of normal human serum. The
bactericidal activity was heatlabile. As regards the sensitivity to
normal human serum, mucoid and non-mucoid variants were not found to

with many precipitins against these bacteria did not differ with
respect to serum sensitivity from strains originating from
intermittently colonized CF patients without P. aeruginosa
precipitins. Compared with normal sera, CF sera showed similar or
higher bactericidal activity against a panel of P. aeruginosa
strains. In this respect, any difference between CF sera with
precipitins and CF sera without precipitins against P. aeurginosa was
not found. Sera from three CF patients chronically infected with P.
aeruginosa, and with many precipitins against these bacteria, showed
a selective inability in bactericidal activity against the patients'
own P. aeruginosa isolate possibly reflecting the presence of

Texto: Treatment of mucus hypersecretion in human disease should first be
directed at prevention.  The hypersecretion of mucus, even in the
absence of pus in the sputum or of other signs of infection, is of
itself associated with significantly poor lung function.  Infection
is probably the important stimulus in cystic fibrosis.  Certain
anti-inflammatory agents are now known to cause retention of mucus
within the secretory cells although the rate of synthesis is not
raised.  It may be that this offers a new way of control.  On the
other hand, the cells become larger and this may be undesirable.  I
would prefer to see a study of the effect of drugs on the cellular
stages of synthesis and discharge rather than concentration on
mucolytic agents.

a single applied shear.  By varying this shear, the associated
detailed variation of viscosity may be studied.  The level of

particular significance in relation to cystic fibrosis.  In cystic

higher than that of macroscopically similar sputum from chronic

Texto: Studies have shown that children with chronic illnesses are more
prone to develop secondary handicaps in the areas of educational
achievement, behavior, and psychological maladjustment than are
'normal' children.  Besides his physical symptoms, the child with a
chronic illness must endure prolonged hospitalization, psychological
stresses, decreased activity, and is often denied opportunity for
skill practice and peer group activities.  All these factors result
in an overall decrease in sensory stimulation which could impair
perceptual-motor functioning as well as the child's ability to
successfully adapt to his disease.  Therefore, the purpose of this
research was to obtain a general idea of the perceptual-motor or
sensory integrative development of children with CF, to determine if
there is, in fact, a need for sensory integrative treatment in the

the hypothesis that early treatment of this condition improves
prognosis. Younger siblings' conditions were diagnosed before 1 year
of age, usually before the onset of pulmonary disease. Older
siblings' conditions were diagnosed after 1 year of age and after the
onset of pulmonary disease. Although the sibling pairs received
similar treatment, comparison at 7 years of age showed that the
younger siblings had significantly better chest roentgenogram scores,
total clinical scores, residual lung volumes, and ratios of residual
volume to total lung volume. Younger siblings also required fewer
hospital admissions to control their lung disease. The results
suggest that, in general, early initiation of therapy is beneficial

Texto: Childhood hepatic steatosis is a commonly and generally benign
reaction that occurs in many pathophysiologic states.  Steatosis
can result from the following mechanism(s): impaired TGC clearance;
increased hepatic lipogenesis; decreased FA oxidation; and increased
lipolysis.  Cystic fibrosis  and syndromes producing pancreatic
insufficiency (pancreatitis) result in a variable degree of
steatosis most probably dependent on the nutritional and hormonal
state of the patient.  Patients with cystic fibrosis have impaired
glucagon and insulin release which alters their fat metabolism.  The
treatment of hepatic steatosis is aimed at the primary cause.

Texto: The article by Townes et al. provides confirmation of our initial
studies with reference to the isoamylase patterns of serum, duodenal
fluid, and urine in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF).  However, the
impression given by Townes et al. in their article is that their data
are the first demonstration of isoamylase abnormalities in cystic
fibrosis.  I wish to point out that out previous work published 2
years earlier and not referenced by Townes et al. demonstrated that
CF patients had decreased amounts of pancreatic isoamylase in their
serum and urine and that the duodenal aspirates in CF patients
contained both salivary and pancreatic amylase.  We concluded, as
eluded to by Townes et al., that salivary amylase in the duodenal
fluid was probably secondary to the intubation procedure.

of patients with asthma and cystic fibrosis were isolated and
characterized. In both cases, lipids constituted 30 to 40 per cent of
the dry insoluble material and phosphatidylcholine was the
predominant lipid. Significant amounts of phosphatidylethanolamine
and phosphatidyglycerol were present. Hexosyl ceramides,
spingomyelin, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and
lyso(bis)phosphatidic acid were present as minor lipid components.
Appreciable quantities of neutral lipids were also found. Significant
amounts of lysophosphatides and free fatty acids were present only in
the lavage sediment from patients with asthma, and not in patients
with cystic fibrosis. Phosphatidylcholine, lysophosphatidycholine,
sphingomyelin, and phosphatidylglycerol of asthmatic lavage, but not
cystic lavage, were highly saturated, containing mostly palmitic
acid.

Texto: It has long been believed that the mucociliary apparatus of the
airways serves to remove inhaled particulate matter from the
tracheobronchial mucosa, thereby contributing to pulmonary host
defense.  This review deals mainly with factors affecting
mucociliary transport that may be of clinical importance.  The
information available at present strongly suggests that mucociliary
transport, at least in central airways, is impaired in most patients
with cystic fibrosis; however, it is still unclear whether this
disorder is a nonspecific feature of the chronic inflammatory airway
disease or represents an essential factor in the pathogenesis of the
pulmonary abnormalities.

Texto: Ventilatory muscles can become fatigued, and this can contribute to
respiratory failure. Patients with chronic obstructive lung disease
may benefit from improving their ventilatory muscle endurance to
improve resistance to fatigue. Ventilatory muscle endurance was
measured in 30 normal subjects and 55 patients with cystic fibrosis
by finding the highest level of normocapnic hyperpnea that could be
sustained for 15 min. Subjects with cystic fibrosis had 36 per cent
higher ventilatory muscle endurance than normal subjects, reflecting
the chronic training stress of breathing against increased
respiratory loads. Four normal subjects and 4 subjects with cystic
fibrosis participated in a specific ventilatory muscle endurance
training program consisting of 25 min per day of maximal normocapnic
hyperpnea 5 days per week for 4 weeks. The cystic fibrosis patients
who trained improved their ventilatory muscle endurance by 51.6 per
cent, whereas the normal subjects who trained showed a 22.1 per cent
increase in ventilatory muscle endurance. Seven subjects with cystic
fibrosis participated in a 4-week physical activity training program
consisting of at least 1.5 hours per day of intensive swimming and
canoeing at summer camp. They increased their ventilatory muscle
endurance by 56.7 per cent. There were no other pulmonary function
changes. Ventilatory muscle endurance can be readily improved in
cystic fibrosis equally well by specific ventilatory muscle endurance
exercise.

Texto: As patients with cystic fibrosis survive longer, the number of
adults with this chronic obstructive lung disease is increasing
rapidly.  Chronic bronchitis and cystic fibrosis are similar in a
number of respects.  The treatment of cystic fibrosis and chronic
bronchitis has some similarities.  But chronic bronchitis and cystic
fibrosis also differ in many respects.  The pathogenesis of chronic
bronchitis is more clearly related to exogonous factors such as
smoking and air pollution than is cystic fibrosis, which is
genetically determined.  Clinical differences also exist.  Major
differences in treatment between cystic fibrosis and chronic
bronchitis are currently in vogue.  Because of the special problems
of adulthood, it is appropriate that many adult patients with cystic
fibrosis be cared for by internists who have previously focused
their attention on chronic bronchitis and emphysema.  Increased
communication between internists and pediatricians on the issue of
cystic fibrosis is badly needed today.

Texto: Lymphocytes from adults homozygous or heterozygous for cystic
fibrosis show biochemical abnormalities when cultured for 48 hours in
the presence of phytohemagglutinin and autologous serum. In contrast
to the 45 per cent increase in total protein and beta-glucuronidase
concentrations seen in healthy control subjects when measured per
10(10) cells, both concentrations decreased by 1 per cent in adults
heterozygous for cystic fibrosis and by 18 per cent in adults
homozygous for cystic fibrosis. The abnormal response of the
lymphocytes from persons with cystic fibrosis was due to a serum
factor and not to any intrinsic abnormality of the lymphocytes. An
abnormal response to hytohemagglutinin occurred in only 14 per cent
of 44 healthy control subjects, but in 100 per cent of 14 adults
homozygous for cystic fibrosis and in 85 per cent of 26 adults
presumed to be heterozygous for cystic fibrosis. As a result of this
phenomenon, lymphocytic beta-glucuronidase concentrations were
significantly lower than normal in patients with cystic fibrosis when
the cells were cultured with phytohemagglutinin and autologous serum.
The demonstration of this phenomenon in both homozygotes and presumed
heterozygotes (parents) suggests a relationship to the genetic defect
in cystic fibrosis.

Texto: Increased fertility of heterozygotes with respect to decreased foetal
loss among offspring of heterozygotes has been proposed by several
authors as a possible explanation for the high gene frequency of CF,
TSD and PKU in certain populations. Studies comparing reproductive
outcome of heterozygotes with reproductive performance in the general
population or in special control groups have been done on several
occasions. These studies, however, are known to be heavily biased, on
the one side by the fact that ascertainment of heterozygotes through
affected offspinrg will tend to underestimate the relative frequency
of smaller families, and on the other side because of the inadequacy
of census data for comparison and the biases inherent in selection of
control families. Careful analysis of the biases involved provides
suggestions for proper corrections. From this a method has been
developed which offers a better approach to the study of heterozygote
fertility in those autosomal recessive conditions which lack a test
for direct heterozygote detection.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis was diagnosed after age 13 in 25 patients. All had an
elevated sweat chloride and either a sibling with cystic fibrosis or
typical pulmonary infection or digestive symptoms caused by exocrine
pancreatic deficiency. Fourteen had long-standing pulmonary or
digestive symptoms. In contrast, four of eight patients whose
symptoms began after age 13 presented with biliary cirrhosis. Three
male patients were asymptomatic at diagnosis. Opacification of all
paranasal sinuses was found in all patients examined radiologically.
At diagnosis, pulmonary-function testing showed obstructive changes
in 19 patients and sputum cultures showed Pseudomonas aeruginosa in
15 patients. Delayed menarche in five of seven female patients and
infertility in the asymptomatic male patient (two of whom were found
to have aspermia) could have led to earlier diagnosis. Teenagers and
young adults with long-standing pulmonary or digestive symptoms,
unexplained cirrhosis, aspermia, or a sibling with cystic fibrosis
should be sweat-tested by pilocarpine iontophoresis.

Texto: The sweat test, even if carried out by an experienced technician,
sometimes lacks reproducibility owing presumably to physiological
variations (patient's diet, temperature, and other factors at present
unrecognized). Some patients are particularly prone to exhibit this
variability and in them a single sweat test is almost valueless. The
aldosterone status is believed to be responsible for a reciprocal
relationship between sweat sodium and potassium concentrations: tests
done on 8 patients show that a high sweat potassium is associated
with a correspondingly lower sodium--a circumstance which must be
borne in mind when interpreting a patient's sweat sodium. Of 30
patients presenting with a variety of symptoms compatible with a
diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and with sweat sodium ranging from 50 to
75 mEq/1 (50-75 mmol/1), only 4 have proved to have cystic fibrosis
after several years of observations; 13 have later been diagnosed as
having asthma. The problem of the 'grey area' of uncertainty is
aggravated by the heterozygous state which is also associated with a
sweat sodium in this range. Repeated sweat tests are indicated if the
sweat sodium lies within the 'grey area', and the diagnostic
importance accorded the test should diminish as the sodium value
approaches this area. The diagnosis of cystic fibrosis must remain in
doubt unless there is strong supportive clinical evidence.

Texto: The average blood serotonin level of 67 children with cystic fibrosis
was found to be about twice that of age-matched normal children.
There was no corresponding increase in the urinary excretion of 5-
hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA). Children with cystic fibrosis were
well able to metabolize serotonin taken by mouth. No significant
correlations were found between the blood serotonin level and the
platelet count, height, weight, skinfold thickness, and pulmonary
function test, 5 out of 44 patients had raised serum IgE levels, and
their mean blood serotonin was higher than in those with normal IgE
levels. No explanation for this emerged. Comparable findings (raised
blood serotonin normal platelet count, normal urinary 5-HIAA) have
been reported only in severe mental retardation. Further study of
this phenomenon is warranted because (a) a raised blood serotonin
level is sufficiently characteristic of cystic fibrosis to explore
its use in diagnosis, and (b) it may help to explain the pathogenesis
of cystic fibrosis and (c) the metabolism and function of serotonin.

suggested that cystic fibrosis might be an acid
mucopolysaccharidosis.  We have seen a similar child.  Aged 5 years
he was admitted to hospital with pneumonia.  In spite of conventional
treatment with cloxacillin and colistin he collapsed and died 48
hours after admission.  The heart was not enlarged, but the
myocardium showed a grossly abnormal appearance with variations in
thickness and extensive areas of firm pale tissue.  Histology of the
heart muscle showed very dramatic changes with severe replacement
fibrosis distributed patchily through the myocardium.  This similar
mixture of neutral and acid mucopolysaccharides was shown in both the
pancreas and the salivary glands.  There have now been a number of
reports of myocardial fibrosis complicating cystic fibrosis.  The
case reported by Mukherji et al. and this case are the first in which
mucopolysaccharide deposits have been found in the myocardium.  The
mixture of neutral and acid mucopolysaccharides in our case does not
support the hypothesis that cystic fibrosis is simply a genetic acid
mucopolysaccharidosis.

Texto: When a genic disorder is only manifest if there are offending
alleles at both loci, as in fibrocystic disease, there is a loss of
two abnormal alleles with each affected birth since the homozygotes
rarely reproduce.  How is this loss compensated?  How could some
50,000 alleles, which can only survive to convey themselves in
effective gametes if they have a normal allelic partner, become
established in the British Isles - and how have some half a million
or more got into the world currency?  First, migrations and
settlements involve the proportion of defective alleles at all loci
being conserved, but their variety being increased.  Secondly, there
could be a general tendency due to some advantage in health or
vitality, which could be manifest by disease resistance, cold
resistance, and by any number of physical or psychological
mechanisms.  Thirdly, there may be 'compensation' - that is the
death of an infant may lead to replacement as a result of which the
replacing sib, if surviving, would have a 2/3 chance of being a
carrier.  Fourthly, the disease may be maintained by mutation.  Of
the four possibilities, three are unrealistic, so that substantial
selective advantage of heterozygotes over the last few hundred years
must be postulated.

highly fluoescent phospholipid derivative
(1-acyl-2-(N-4-nitrobenzo-2-oxa-1,3-diazole)--aminocaproyl
phosphatidylcholine (NBD-PC), when incorporated in the plasma
membranes of normal and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts.  Fluorescence
polarization measurements indicate that the fluorochrome has a much
higher degree of rotational mobility in cystic fibrosis fibroblasts
as compared with normal cells.  Temperature dependent transitions in
the emission intensity of NBD-PC incorporated in normal fibroblasts
are indicated at 17.7 and 21.2 degrees C while the abnormal cell

These differences might be due to changes in plasma membrane

Texto: Nine lysomal enzymes and alkaline phosphatase have been assayed with
two different ultramicro techniques in the intra- and extracellular
space of fibroblast cultures derived from the skin of cystic
fibrosis patients, cystic fibrosis carriers, and normals controls,
respectively.  Evidence has been obtained for a multiple leakage of
lysomal enzymes and of alkaline phosphatase into the medium of
fibroblast cultures from cystic fibrosis patients and carriers.  The
situation is comparable to a certain extent, to that observed in
I-cell-disease (mucolipidosis II).  This multiple leakage results in
the decrease of intracellular activity of several lysosomal enzymes
in cultures from cystic fibrosis patients and carriers and due to
the coordinate regulationof the synthesis of the "leaky enzymes" in
an overshooting of the intracellular alkaline phosphatase activity
in cultures from cystic fibrosis patients.  It also explains the
retarded catabolism of certain molecules, such as the Tamm-Horsfall
glycoprotein, in cystic fibrosis cells.  It is speculated that the
basic defect in cystic fibrosis leads to abnormal recognition sites
on lysosomal enzymes and on alkaline phosphatase, and in consequence
to the leakage of those enzymes into the extracellular space.  The
present findings allow one to develop methods for the pre- and
postnatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis with cell cultures, and for
the detection of cystic fibrosis carriers with the peripheral blood.

accumulation and efflux are quite similar in all the strains studied
except for WI-38, which showed somewhat higher efflux and lower
accumulation than for others. There was no significant difference in
the kinetic parameters of methionine transport between CF and normal
skin fibroblasts, and methionine transport will not serve as a marker

Texto: Cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) is the most common potentially
lethal autosomal recessive disease in Caucasian peoples.  Despite
much research and several promising leads there is no completely
reliable test for detecting heterozygotes, nor a test for the
identification of the affected homozygous fetus in utero.  Attention
is being focused on the value and the means of screening newborn
infants.  Pilot studies carried out in the past six years have
indicated two main possibilities.  Firstly, the examination of
meconium for excess albumin, refined to include immunoelectrophoretic
estimation of the albumin alpha-1 antitrypsin ratio, disaccharidases,
and lysosomal enzymes.  A second approach is based on the work with a
chloride-sensitive electrode, which has been modified recently to
give greater precision in measurement of neonatal sweat electrolytes.
While the tests available are reasonably accurate, collaborative
trials and respiratory could improve their efficiency still further.
Nevertheless, any screening test is presumptive only, and there must
be an adequate back-up service with a specific validated diagnostic
test.

Texto: Validation of rigid-tube bronchoscopy with small-volume (5-ml
increments not to exceed 300 ml) bronchial washing as a therapeutic
adjunct was performed on six patients with cystic fibrosis, using
serial tests of pulmonary function as a yardstick for assessment of
efficacy. Two patients did not undergo the procedure and served as
control subjects. All patients were characterized as having varying
severity of pulmonary involvement. Large central airways were
severely obstructed, and older patients had more trapped gas in their
lungs. Hypoxemia and large alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure
differences [P(A-a)O2] were due to inhomogeneity of alveolar
ventilation. Results indicated that up to ten days to two weeks,
bronchoscopic bronchial washing may in some instances improve maximal
expiratory flow-volume curves and specific airway conductance and
decrease P(A-a)O2 towards normal. Distribution of alveolar gas P(A-
a)O2 towards normal. Distribution of alveolar gas became more
homogeneous. We conclude that bronchoscopic bronchial washing may be
effective in the management of patients with cystic fibrosis, by
augmentation of their inadequate cleansing function of the conducting
airways.

abnormalities in cardiac rate or rhythm were observed with the
lavages directed by fiberoptic bronchoscope. Fifty-six lavages were
performed under general anesthesia with 20 cardiac abnormalities

improvement was apparent in 45% of the 24 patients who had lavage

fumigatus whereas only 8-10% had either raised specific IgE or PCA
reaction to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus.  Abolition of the PCA
activity by incubating the C.F. sera or sputum at 56 degrees C

reactions to a number of allergens could be detected in both the
C.F. sputum and saliva.  Several of the C.F. heterozygotes had a
strongly positive history of allergy and a significant number of
these heterozygotes had an elevated serum total IgE as well as
positive PCA to Timothy grass pollen or to D. pteronyssinus similar
to the patients with asthma or hay fever.  Three C.F. patients who

different allergens, suggesting that immediate hypersensitivity is
of some significance in patients with C.F.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis (CF) children had a greater variability of skin prick
test response compared with asthmatic children, when the tests were
performed on two occasions. This suggests that there is a different
cause for the allergy in the two groups, perhaps because the
asthmatics have a transient period of susceptibility to sensitization
in infancy and the CF children a persistent vulnerability. Amongst
the asthmatic children, clinical improvement was associated with loss
of some skin prick test reactions, and clinical deterioration with an
increase in the number of positive reactions. Thus continuing
allergic reactions may maintain a mucosal defect, resulting in a
persistence of susceptibility to allergen sensitization, and control
of the reactions may re-establish normal mucosal defence mechanisms.

activity in the patients' plasma was not significantly different from
controls. Fucosidase activity was similar also for both groups. The
protein bands of the acceptor glycoproteins from the patients' saliva

propose that glycoprotein in the salivary secretion of E A patients
are qualitatively different from normal.

test has been developed which allows one to screen small numbers of

Automated ultramicro enzyme assays should contribute to the general

An inhibitor protein (from wheat) with a 100-fold greater specificity
for human salivary than for human pancreatic amylase was used to
analyze mixtures of the two enzymes. The concentration of pancreatic
and salivary amyalase was determined in 141 normal sera (72 men and
69 women). Statistically significant differences were found for serum
pancreatic amylase between mean and women, higher values being shown
in women. No sex-related difference was found for the salivary
component of serum amylase. With this method, the increase in serum
amylase activity in pancreatitis was shown to be attributable to the
pancreatic component. In mumps, the increase is attributable to the
salivary component. In pancreatic insufficiency, serum pancreatic
amylase activities were significantly lower than in the controls. Our
method is simple and rapid; our results agree well with those of
other authors who used chromatographic or electrophoretic methods.

activity was resistant to inhibition by a high molecular weight
inhibitor. During iincubation at 38 degrees C the complex with normal
alpha2-macroglobulin was slowly inhibited by the high molecular
weight inhibitor and regained activity with the high molecular weight
substrate. This phenomenon was not obtained when the alpha2-

that the gradual conversion of normal alpha2-macroglobulin-trypsin

Texto: Pancreatic development begins during the fourth week of gestation.
In annular pancreas, the ventral pancreas fails to migrate to the
right of the duodenum.  Duplication of the pancreatic ducts is a
rare entity, probably arising from accidental misplacement of
mucosal cells from the duodenum or stomach during the development of
the pancreatic pouches.  Congenital pancreatic cysts may be single,
multiple, unilocular or multilocular and can be associated with
polycystic disease of the kidney, liver or spleen.  Ectopic pancreas
occurs before or during the rotation of the ventral pancreas and its
fusion with the dorsal pancreas.  Few tumours of the pancreas have
been reported in children less than 15 years of age.  The evaluation
of patients via different pancreatic function tests is significant
only when the results are interpreted in the light of clinical
manifestations.  Tests of exocrine pancreatic function in childhood
include stool examination, the triolein test, blood examination,
analysis of duodenal contents, the secretin-pancreozymin test,
pancreatic scanning with selenomethionine, transduodenal
pancreatogram, abdominal ultrasound and arteriography, and upper
gastrointestinal x-ray.  The most prevalent disorder of the pancreas
in infancy and childhood is exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.  Well
over 96 per cent of infants and children with pancreatic
insufficiency have cystic fibrosis.  Shwachman syndrome is the
second most common cause of pancreatic insufficiency and is
associated with neutropenia, metaphyseal dystosis, sever stunting of
growth, eczema, and susceptibility to infections.  Patients with
cystic fibrosis who have partial pancreatic insufficiency sometimes
show dissociation of different enzyme activities.  Although
pancreatitis is comparatively rare in infancy and childhood, we
suspect that it is often overlooked.

Texto: We suggest that the intrauterine detection of cystic fibrosis may be
based on the investigation of the amniotic fluid.  It is known that
the protein content of the meconium of homozygotic newborn infants
is significantly increased, whereas that of heterozygotic infants is
only moderately increased.  As a result of intrauterine intestinal
activity, the bowel content may be excreted into the amniotic fluid;
thus a detectable deviation in the protein content of amniotic fluid
may be expected.  We decided to determine the total protein content
and the amount of acid-soluble glycoproteins in 86 amniotic fluid
samples, both by polography and by measuring the hexose content.  In
the homozygous case a slight increase was observed in total protein
content, whereas in the heterozygous cases no changes were observed.

Texto: A group of 102 obligate heterozygotes for the cystic fibrosis gene
were examined for genetic type of pancreatic isoamylases as well as
enzyme activity of pancreatic iso-amylases, salivary isoamylases and
total amylase in serum. The analysis was performed using
electrophoretic separation for detection of the various types of
isoamylases, and their relative activity was determined by means of
densitometry. The activities of salivary isoamylases and total
amylase in serum showed no significant differences between the cystic
fibrosis heterozygotes and a control group. The frequency of the
variant gene for pancreatic isoamylase was also the same as in the
controls. The mean value for pancreatic isoamylase was slightly
higher in the cystic fibrosis heterozygotes than in the control group
(0.05 greater than P greater than 0.02).

Texto: Bioassays using ciliary systems have detected a factor or factors in
cystic fibrosis (CF) sera and tissue culture medium derived from CF
cells. The typical shortcomings of an assay measuring biological
activity have been studied, and the means to overcome the weaknesses
of the oyster gill cilia assay have been established. The presence of
the cystic fibrosis mucociliary inhibitor (CFMI) in experimental
fractions may be determined by accepting data from only those assays
in which authentic CF and normal (non-CF) fractions give defined
reactions, by measuring the reaction of each sample at least three
times, and by examining each experimental sample at a protein
concentration greater than the minimum established in this study. The
relative concentrations of the CFMI present in the first steps of
purification of serum and medium have been calculated in terms of
units of inhibition. Generally, the units of inhibition present in
serum and medium fractions from heterozygotes are close to one-half
of that in fractions from homozygous sources. Analogous fractions
concentrated from a normal (non-CF) source never inhibited
mucociliary activity, even when tested at nearly 100 times the CF
concentration. Ciliary assays utilizing oyster gills are essential
for monitoring fractionation procedures aimed at purifying the CFMI,
and have been shown to be capable and reliable enough to do so.

Texto: Although the majority of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) show a
typical clinical course, a minority with the same clinical phenotype
at the time of initial diagnosis have an atypical (mild) course. Skin
fibroblast cultures were established from 49 members of the family of
one such atypical CF adult patient, previously identified (Danes et
al. 1976) as CF Class II (ametachromatic and no metabolic cooperation
with CF Class I fibroblasts), the offspring of Class I
(metachromatic, metabolic cooperation with normal fibroblasts)/Class
II mating. The culture phenotype for Class I was traced on the
maternal side and for Class II on the paternal side through
consecutive generations and the culture phenotype of each class
segregated. This family study added experimental evidence to support
the hypothesis that the atypical (mild) clinical features and course
of this adult CF patient were due to two different CF genes combining
to produce a genetic compound expressing a mild form of CF.

neuritis and peripheral neuritis have been reported to follow
treatment with chloramphenicol.  This toxic sequel appears to be

other diseases who are treated with chloramphenicol, the risk of
devastating bone marrow toxicity has been estimated to range from
1:40,000 to 1:100,000.  We have found only two reports of patients

depression of the erythroid bone marrow, anorexia, weight loss,
temporary hair loss and retardation of growth after prolonged

Texto: The five major diseases of the pancreas together make a significant
contribution to morbidity and mortality among the people of the
United States. These diseases are diabetes, cystic fibrosis, acute
and chronic pancreatitis, and carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas.
Four of these diseases can be modeled in laboratory animals by acute
or chronic administration of chemical poisons or carcinogens. Human
pancreatic diseases attributed to the effect of chemical agents
including alcohol and drugs include many cases of chronic
pancreatitis and some cases of acute pancreatitis. The cause is not
known in many cases of human pancreatitis, including interstitial,
acute, and chronic clinical forms. Epidemiologic studies suggest that
the increasing incidence of carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas in the
United States may reflect chemical carcinogenesis. On the basis of
experimental observations, we know that pancreatic islet cells can be
damaged directly by toxic chemicals, and that islet cell tumors can
be chemically induced. Thus, there is adequate background data to
conclude that several pancreatic diseases of obscure etiology may be
due in part to hitherto unidentified toxic effects of chemical agents
encountered in personal or general environments.

Texto: In 21 children with cystic fibrosis, the vectorcardiogram (VCG) was
correlated with various indices of the severity of the disease. The
best correlation was found between (1) the azimuth angle of the
spatial QRS loop area, representing the rightward and posterior shift
of the main electrical forces, and pulmonary function tests (PFT):
FEV1 % predicted (r = -0.671, P less than 0.005) and VC% predicted (r
= -0.607, P less than 0.005), and (2) the right ventricular anterior
wall index measured echocardiographically (r = 0.472, P less than
0.05). More VCG parameters correlated significantly with PFT than
with the echocardiogram. This shows the major influence of pulmonary
changes on the VCG of those patients. In several subgroups with
different clinical scores, the VCG were analyzed and compared to
normal limits of age- and sex-matched controls. In this small series,
the VCG was a specific but not very sensitive method for predicting
the degree of severity of the disease. Echocardiography and
vectorcardiography can be considered as two complementary techniques
in the evaluation of cystic fibrosis.

Texto: On electrophoresis, parotid saliva always exhibits a basic pattern of
6 isoamylases. Additional faster migrating isoamylases occur in
varying numbers. These "fast isoamylases" are generated, at least in
part, by deamidation. Compared with juvenile and adult controls, a
significantly greater number of "fast isoamylases" was found in the
parotid saliva of children with cystic fibrosis and their healthy
heterozygous parents. A shift in the equilibrium between amidation
and deamidation is discussed in terms of its possible connection with
the metabolic defect responsible for cystic fibrosis.

Texto: We have previously demonstrated that cystic fibrosis (CF) cells show
increased survival compared to normal cells when exposed to ouabain
in medium lacking potassium.  In this report, we show that the CF
cells bind significantly less ouabain than the normal cells in
potassium-deficient medium.  Using age-matched normal and CF skin
fibroblast strains, we show that (1) at ouabain concentrations <
20x10-9 M binding for both normal and CF cells is linear with time
for 1 h and reaches equilibrium after 4 h; (2) at ouabain
concentrations between 2 and 20x10-9 M, the initial rate of binding
for CF cells is approx. 70% of the normal cells; (3) under
equilibrium-binding conditions, Scatchard analysis reveals that
three different CF strains have 12, 16, and 44% fewer
ouabain-binding sites than their matched normal controls.  In
addition, studies in potassium-free medium of the inhibition of
86Rb flux (a K-plus analogue) into the cell by ouabain show no
differences between CF and normal cells.  We have also previously
shown that in a low glucose, potassium-deficient medium the CF cells
survived ouabain exposure no better than normal cells.  In this
report, equilibrium-binding studies with [3H]ouabain clearly show
that CF cells bind less ouabain under these conditions than normal
cells.  These results indicate that ouabain resistance in CF cells
is not solely a function of differences in ouabain binding.
Furthermore, the differential ouabain killing may not be due to ion
transport differences, but rather to as yet unknown mechanisms.  CF
cells thus appear to be unlike previously characterized
ouabain-resistant mutants.

homogenates from children with cystic fibrosis is decreased.
Recordnum: 00657
Texto: This study was undertaken because of reports of a marked increase in
fecal bile acid excretion by children with cystic fibrosis. We
attempted to confirm this finding by performing [1-14C]cholylglycine
breath tests and by measuring fecal bile acid and fat excretion in
patients with cystic fibrosis and acquired pancreatic insufficiency.
Studies were done when patients were taking pancreatic enzymes
(Cotazym) and also without medication. 14CO2 excretion in breath was
normal in patients with acquired pancreatic insufficiency and even
lower in cystic fibrosis, both with and without Cotazym therapy.
Fecal bile acid excretion was slightly elevated in both groups
without Cotazym and became normal with Cotazym in patients with
acquired pancreatic insufficiency. Steatorrhea was present in both
patient groups and improved during Cotazym therapy. Bile acid
malabsorption in cystic fibrosis and acquired pancreatic
insufficiency is minimal and probably not clinically important.

Texto: Roller and Kern report that bile acid malabsorption in patients with
cystic fibrosis (CF) and acquired pancreatic insufficiency is
minimal.  These findings are at variance with other studies and
deserve comment.  In the absence of fecal bile acid values in
controls, the authors cannot state that levels in CF are only twice
normal values, especially since the papers cited on normal bile acid
excretion refer to measurements obtained by a different technique.
We also question the validity of the breath test as an index of bile
acid malabsorption in CF.  Our recent report shows that in 8 older CF
(mean age 12.1 years) the magnitude of bile acid loss in the stools
was comparable to that of the younger age group (mean age 3.9 years)
and that there was no correlation between the age and the degree of
bile acid loss.  On the other hand, we must take issue with Roller
and Kern when they suggest that bile acid malabsorption in CF is
probably not clinically important.  Our findings not only bear
relevance to the intestinal manifestations of CF and to the increased
incidence of cholelithiasis but perhaps also to the early deposition
within the intrahepatic ducts of eosinophilic mucus concretions
proposed as the cause of biliary cirrhosis in this disease.

the years 1950 through 1975. In a child or young adult with known or
suspected cystic fibrosis, the triad of recurrent colicky abdominal
pain, a mass in the right lower quadrant, and mechanical intestinal
obstruction provides a clue to diagnosis of meconium ileus
equivalent. The clinical suspicion of meconium ileus equivalent may
be confirmed by meglumine diatrizoate (Gastrografin) enema, which in

Texto: Bile acid kinetics was investigated by stable isotope dilution
technique in 6 children (ages 3 1/2 months to 4 1/2 years) with
previously untreated cystic fibrosis.  All of the patients had
clinical and laboratory evidence of malabsorption, normal
intestinal mucosal function, as judged by glucose absorption,
intestinal histology, disaccharidase levels, and normally
functioning gallbladders.  The children were maintained on a
constant diet throughout the study period; fat intake averaged 4.2 g
per kg per day.  Before administration of pancreatic enzyme
replacement, fat excretion equalled 50 plus or minus 4% (mean plus
or minus SE) of intake and was reduced to 20 plus or minus 1.0% of
intake after therapy.  Total bile acid pool size nearly doubled
during enzyme replacement from 379 plus or minus 32 micromoles per
kg to 620 plus or minus 36 micromoles per kg with secondary bile
acids comprising 57% of the total pool before therapy and 40% after
therapy.  Total bile acid synthesis changed little with therapy,
equalling 139 plus or minus 17 micromoles per kg per day (total 602
plus or minus 109 mg per day) without enzyme replacement and 125
plus or minus 19 micromoles per kg per day (total 470 plus or minus
86 milligrams per day) with enzyme replacement.  This was confirmed
by the fecal excretion of bile acids: 545 plus or minus 166
milligrams of bile acid per day were excreted without enzymes as
compared to 513 plus or minus 146 milligrams per day with enzymes.
After therapy, the fractional turnover rate of the bile acid pool
was reduced from 0.602 plus or minus 0.05 per day to 0.233 plus or
minus .03 per day for cholic acidand from 0.696 plus or minus 0.09
per day to 0.39 plus or minus 0.04 per day for chenodeoxycholic
acid.  These data indicate that both primary and secondary bile
acids are conserved within the enterohepatic circulation during
enzyme therapy, and that the mechanism for the regulation of hepatic
bile acid synthesis is intact in cystic fibrosis.  However, the
demonstration that large amounts of bile acid continue to be
excreted during therapy suggests that interruption of the
enterohepatic circulation continues and that deficiencies of the
intraluminal phase may persist during enzyme therapy in this
disease.

Texto: The survival rates in 204 patients suffering from cystic fibrosis
observed between January 1956 and June 1976 were recorded. The
patients were divided into five groups according to the symptoms
present at the time of diagnosis and survival rates were recorded
separately for each group. Survival was less good in the group of
patients presenting initially with pulmonary symptoms compared to the
group presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms. In the group
presenting with meconium ileus survival was poor initially, but later
in the course of the disease it became similar to that observed in
the other groups. The differences in survival between the different
categories occurred during the first two years after diagnosis. The
study shows that, on clinical grounds, a severe form of the disease
which is characterized by early manifestation of pulmonary symptoms
and poor survival can be distinguished from a more protracted form
with a better survival. Because of the great inter-individual
variability large numbers of patients will have to be evaluated in
order to achieve statistically significant results in studies which
attempt to compare different therapeutic approaches. If such numbers
cannot be reached, it may be necessary to compare only patients who
belong to the same symptomatic category.

age were studied before and after treatment with lyophilized pancreas
and compared to 27 controls. CF was characterized by lower

concentrations and reduced coefficient of fat absorption. Treatment
tended towards normalization of these values. With age
polyunsaturated fatty acids increased in normals but not in CF. The
significant correlations existing between fat absorption coefficient
and polyunsaturated fatty acid percentage in neutral lipids of CF
children suggests the use of the latter percentage as index of the

a recessive disease has been studied. The frequency of first cousin

7.1% nephronophtisis: 5.6% spinal muscular atrophy: 4.5% albinism:
5.0% achromatopsia: 12.5% (Albinism and spinal muscular atrophy are

cousin marriage relative to that of the general population is much
greater, as expected, in cystinosis, which is a rare disease, than in
cystic fibrosis, which is the most frequent recessive disorder in
France. Inbreeding in cystinosis and cystic fibrosis was also studied
by computing the distance between parental birth places. This
distance is smaller in cystinosis than in cystic fibrosis.

Texto: The apparent frequency of the recessive autosomal allele for cystic
fibrosis (cf) is too high to be satisfactorily explained by mutation
equilibrium. However, higher reproductive fitness by heterozygotes
(expressed by t greater than 0) or higher gametic viability of the cf
allele (expressed by a greater than 0.5) can provide reasonable
explanations of the present frequency. Furthermore, birth replacement
in families with CF children (RPE) can account for the estimated
historical values of t. Today, however, t is probably at or
approaching zero as a result of discontinuation of RPE. In the future
we can look for an imperceptibly slow decrease in the incidence of
CF. Reproduction by CF females will not cause an increase in
incidence; it will only slightly slow the rate of decrease.

gestation to 30 years were obtained at autopsy. Patients were divided
into two groups based on the presence or absence of chronic
hypoxemia. There was a high correlation between the weight of
individual carotid bodies in each case. Among the 12 patients with
chronic hypoxemia, eight patients had carotid bodies heavier than
predicted by statistical analysis. Of these eight patients, six had
cystic fibrosis and two had cyanotic heart disease. Morphometric and
cell population analyses of the carotid bodies from these eight
patients and from those of the control population indicated that
enlargement of the carotid bodies during normal or abnormal growth
results from proportionate increases in lobule parenchyma and stroma.
There was also an increase in the width and length of the lobules
without an increase in the diameter of the cell cords or a change in
the size or proportion of the chief cells. Growth and development of
the carotid bodies were studied in a control group of 59 patients
without chronic hypoxemia. There were no sex related differences in
carotid body weights. The combined weight of the carotid bodies
correlated most strongly with body weight, although there was some
correlation with age and body length. A regression equation
reflecting the data relating to body weight (BW) is: Combined weight
of carotid bodies (in mg.) = 0.29 BW (in kg.) +3.0. Leukemic

Texto: Phospholipase A2, lysolecithinase, and lysolecithin-lysolecithin
acyltransferase are present in the airway secretions of patients
with asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), and alveolar proteinosis.  Assays
of these enzymes under the same conditions in extracts of human
polymorphonuclear leukocytes, alveolar macrophages, and pig tracheal
mucosa indicated that these extracellular airway enzymes were
probably not derived from these cell types.  Although the above
three enzymes were present in secretions of all patients with these
three diseases, large amounts of palmitoyl lysolecithin, free fatty
acids, and dipalmitoyl lecithin were found only in patients having
alveolar proteinosis and asthma.  The amount of free fatty acids in
these secretions was sufficient to inhibit both the lysolecithinase
and the lysolecithin-lysolecithin acyltransferase, but not the
phospholipase A2.  These findings suggest that the large amount of
dipalmitoyl lecithin, free fatty acids, and lysolecithin found in
these secretions results from extracellular remodelling by these
enzymes.  Because the phospholipase A2 was present in large amounts,
it was possible after delipidation to purify it to homogeneity.  It
is a stable enzyme with an apparent molecular weight of 75,000 as
estimated by SDS-mercaptoethanol gel electrophoresis.

However, skin testing for immediate hypersensitivity with either

Texto: The oral conditions of 42 patients being treated for cystic fibrosis
were evaluated. The patients were grouped by age and, in some
aspects, were compared with a small control group of their siblings.
The patient group had a lowered incidence of plaque and less gingival
disease than did the control group in which every person had some
amount of plaque or gingival disease. Calculus formation was minimal.
The reasons for the finding of minimal plaque in the patient group
could be related to several factors, including the life-long use of
various antibiotic agents, the chewing of digestive enzyme
supplements, the effect of medical management on tooth hardness, and
the effect of stained teeth (possible tetracycline deposition) on the
plaque microorganisms. It appears that the therapy for cystic
fibrosis was beneficial to the periodontal health of these patients.
Much further study is needed to understand the interrelationship
between an altered oral environment (salivary changes in cystic
fibrosis), altered microbial flora (by antibiotics, enzymes) and even
altered tooth surfaces (possible tetracycline deposition). Most
patients were found to have one or more oral habits. Tooth mobility
was associated with tension habits. Patients who had clubbed fingers
(indicating pulmonary compromise) and possibly a severe disease
process, did not appear to have either stained teeth or the severity
of the gingivitis associated with this. The relationship of
tetracycline to tooth staining could not be pinpointed.

for idealized timed vital capacity (TVC) and maximal expiratory flow-

average flow over the middle half (FEF25-75%) of the forced vital

computed. From the TVC moments, a mean transit time (MTT) and an
index of dispersion (ID) were also calculated. The minimum
information needed to detect pulmonary mechanical changes associated
with obstructive lung disease requires at least two reproducible

healthy controls and three patients with cystic fibrosis.  The
normal and patient preparations were indistinguishable antigenically
and in their UV absorption spectra.  Competitive inhibition by these

bovine trypsin was observed.  The Ki value for normal
alpha-2-macroglobulin was 5.3 x 10-8 M as compared to 1.8 x 10-7 M
for cystic fibrosis patients preparations.  The km values of the
alpha-2-macroglobulin-trypsin complex were 6.3 x 10-4 M for the
normal protein and 1.5 x 10-4 M with the alpha-2-macroglobulin from
the cystic fibrosis patients.  Gel chromatography of normal
alpha-2-macroglobulin, preincubated in molar ratios with bovine

These fragments were not obtained with the preparations from the
cystic fibrosis patients.  Both the normal and cystic fibrosis
alpha-2-macroglobulins were shown by gel chromatography in sodium
dodecyl sulfate to be tetramers, noncovalently bound.  After

patients with pancreatogenic steatorrhea revealed that all were

varied markedly but correlated with indices of intestinal
malabsorption, such as the serum carotene concentration and
percentage of dietary fat absorbed.  Supplementation with 5-10
times the recommended daily allowance of vitamin E in a
water-miscible form increased the plasma alpha-tocopherol
concentrations to normal in all 19 CF patients so evaluated.
Studies on the effects of vitamin E deficiency focused on possible
hematologic alterations.  An improved technique was developed to
measure erythrocyte hemolysis in vitro in the presence of hydrogen
peroxide.  While erythrocyte suspensions from control subjects
demonstrated resistance to hemolysis during a 3-h incubation, all
samples from tocopherol-deficient CF patients showed abnormal
oxidant susceptibility, evidenced by greater than 5% hemoglobin
release.  The degree of peroxide-induced hemolysis was related to
the plasma alpha-tocopherol concentrationin an inverse, sigmoidal
manner.  The possibility of in vivo hemolysis was assessed by
measuring the survival of 51Cr-labeled erythrocytes in 19 vitamin-E
deficient patients.  A moderate but statistically significant
decrease in the mean 51Cr erythrocyte half-life value was found in
this group.  Measurement of erythrocyte survival before and after
supplementation of 6 patients with vitamin E demonstrated that the
shortened erythrocyte lifespan could be corrected to normal with
this treatment.  Other hematologic indices in deficient subjects,
however, were normal and did not change upon supplementation with
vitamin E.  It is concluded that CF is invariably associated with
vitamin E deficiency, provided that the patient in question has
pancreatic achylia and is not taking supplementary doses of
tocopherol.  Concomitant hematologic effects consistent with mild
hemolysis, but not anemia, occur and may be reversed with vitamin E
therapy.  Patients with CF should be given daily doses of a
water-miscible form of vitamin E to correct the deficiency.

Jersey/NJ)/76 (HssN1) and A/Victoria/75 inactivated influenza virus
vaccines were studied in 125 children aged three to 18 years. In
recruitment, families who knew the study team, who were
professionally involved, and/or who were under close continuing care
were more likely to volunteer for such studies than those who were
unfamiliar with the team or institution. Antibody responses and
systemic reactions occurred more often after administration of

Significant titers (greater than or equal to 1:40) of
hemagglutination-inhibiting antibody to A/NJ/76 virus occurred in 95%

with cystic fibrosis (CF) was studied after administration of single
intravenous doses of 15 mg/kg. The area under the serum concentration
vs. time curve for CF patients was, on the average, only 75% of that
found for normal subjects. The low concentrations in serum were
caused by more rapid urinary excretion of the antibiotic, with rates
of renal clearance averaging 425 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in the patients
with CF and 362 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in the normal subjects. No
differences were found in volumes of distribution and metabolic
clearance rates of methicillin or in rates of creatinine clearance
between the two groups of subjects. These data support previous
findings with dicloxacillin which show that patients with CF exhibit
unusually rapid, active tubular secretion of certain penicillins that
may necessitate use of larger doses of these drugs in treatment of
infections.

plasma prekallikrein is defective in cystic fibrosis. In contrast, no
such difference was demonstrable between normal and cystic fibrosis
plasma. Esterolytic activity for the synthetic substrate p-toluene
sulfonyl-arginine methyl ester (TAMe) evolved normally in cystic
fibrosis plasma treated with chloroform and ellagic acid, a measure
of generation of plasma kallikrein. Additionally, plasma
prekallikrein (Fletcher factor) and high molecular weight kininogen
(Fitzgerald factor), a substrate of plasma kallikrein, were normal.
Thus, the concept that cystic fibrosis is associated with
abnormalities in the plasma kallikrein-kinin system could not be

Texto: The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone was
observed in two patients with cystic fibrosis during acute
exacerbation of chronic pulmonary disease. It was diagnosed by the
accepted clinical and laboratory criteria and confirmed in one case
by values for immunoreactive vasopressin that were inappropriately
high for plasma osmolality. The severe hyponatremia was corrected by
fluid restriction, alone or combined with intravenous treatment with
diuretic and hypertonic saline solution. In addition, there was
simultaneous therapy of the pulmonary disease. SIADH thus must be
added to salt loss as a cause of hyponatremia in CF, and may be more
common than realized in patients with CF and severe pulmonary
disease.

nasal mucosa. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis
that CF serum inhibits MCC in vivo in the inflamed mucosa.

Texto: The pharmacokinetic variables of amikacin were measured in 20
children  and adolescents, four to 16 years of age.  The mean
plasma clearance of amikacin was 120 ml/minute/1.73 m2.  The major
route of elimination was renal (82%).  Simultaneously measured
inulin clearance showed that a majority (64%) of the drug filtered
by the kidneys was excreted in the urine.  The mean volume of
distribution of amikacin was 32% of body weight; half-life during
the final (pseudoequilibrium) phase averaged 1.6 hours.  No
significant accumulation of the drug was seen when four doses were
given intravenously at 420 mg/m2 every 8 hours; the plasma
concentration just before injection of the fourth dose averaged 2.4
plus or minus 1.1 microgram/ml.  The mean plasma concentration at 60
to 75 minutes after injection of the drug was 28.7 microg/ml with
little interpatient variation (SD 3.5 microg/ml).  When the dose was
expressed in terms of milligrams per kilogram, it was found that
children often needed 50 to 100% more of the drug, compared to
adults, to achieve equivalent plasma concentrations; this larger
requirement was primarily due to a higher clearance of amikacin in
proportion to body weight.  Dosages based on surface area, however,
resulted in uniform requirements and predictable plasma
concentrations in all patients studied.

Texto: The relationship between the dosage of pancreatic extract and the
excretion of uric acid was investigated in 29 patients with cystic
fibrosis and exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Urinary excretion of
uric acid was normal in patients receiving small doses of pancreatic
extracts and abnormally high in those receiving large amounts. In the
latter group, normouricosuria was achieved by reducing the dose of
pancreatic extract. Normal stool patterns and adequate weight gains
were preserved by a diet modification that was well accepted by the
patients. To eliminate the potential renal consequences of
hyperuricosuria, it seems appropriate to control the need for
increasing amounts of pancreatic enzymes by limiting the dietary
intake of fat and maintaining a positive caloric and nitrogen balance
with high intake of protein and carbohydrates and supplementation
with medium-chain triglycerides.

Texto: The possibility has been raised that complement plays a role in the
pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis (CF).  This impairment would be
consistent with the thesis that the alternative pathway had been
activated in vivo and, therefore, depleted.  The purpose of this work
is to explore further the function of the alternative pathway in
cystic fibrosis.  Examination of the data using Student's t test and
analysis of variance showed no significant difference in the mean
hemolytic activity of sera of CF patients as compared to the control
group.  The data presented do not support the work of Polley and
Bearn who demonstrated an abnormality in CF patients using conversion
of C3 by inulin as assay.  The reason for this discrepancy is not
clear.  Our results do not preclude in vivo activation of the
alternative pathway, since a compensatory increase in synthesis of
components could offset component consumption.  Since the net result
is a completely normal level of activity, however, it does not seem
likely that significant consumption has occurred.

Rather, the changes were those described in neonatal hepatitis and,

is likely that the giant cell hepatitis was a coincidental finding,
unrelated to CF.  It emphasizes, however, that one cannot assume a
uniform etiology for all instances of obstructive jaundice seen in

extracts, in the doses currently used in the management of patients
with cystic fibrosis, cause hyperuricosuria which may occasionally be
symptomatic.  They correctly worry about long-term ill effects of
such therapy.  In treated CF patients the uricosuria results
primarily from the increased dietary purine load, though the abnormal
transport physiology in CF may contribute.  Even though final
evidence on risk is not at hand, prudence would suggest holding the
purine load in CF patients to the minimum needed to ensure digestion
of sufficient foodstuffs without necessarily permitting a "normal"
diet sans steatorrhea.  Alternatively, purified enzyme preparations
free of the remaining sweetbread could eliminate the excess nucleic
acid intake and be administered in a dosage permitting the luxury of
redundant safety.

[ADH] secretion [SIADH] as a cause of hyponatremia in cystic fibrosis
[CF]," we are puzzled by certain unusual phenomena in the two cases
presented.  We agree that it would be important to recognize the
occurrence of ADH mediated hyponatremia in CF.  We would, though,
appreciate the authors' comments on the weight losses and the fluid
and electrolyte balances early in these patients's courses.  Also
helpful would be information on furosemide dosage and any other
drugs, such as acetaminophen, which may have been given so we can
further understand the pathophysiology of these two complex patients.
- We do not think there was hypovolemia in either case.  Patient 1
was given only one dose of 600 mg of acetaminophen on the fourth day
of hospitalization during recovery.  Patient 2 received only one dose
of acetaminophen (650 mg) at 2 AM on the twenty-first day of
admission after recovery.  Both patients were receiving antibiotics
and Patient 2 was receiving digitalis as well.  The reason for
production of ADH remains obscure as it is in most cases of SIADH,
although it was mentioned in the discussion that the transient nature
of SIADH in these patients with cystic fibrosis would argue against
the production of this hormone in the lung.

in glucose during OGTT. In each group basal glucagon concentrations
were normal and supressed appropriately (p less than 0.05) after
glucose; insulin responses were attenuated and the peak responses
delayed. During arginine stimulation, insulin secretion was impaired
in each group. However, glucagon secretion was diminished only in
Group II. Thus, insulinopenia was found in both groups and
hyperglucagonemia was not found as a contributory factor to the
hyperglycemia in Group II.

most important determinant of response to treatment. Ticarcillin-

patients who received this drug; recovery of them was not prevented
by the inclusion of gentamicin in the therapeutic regimen nor did
they interfere with clinical improvement. The ticarcillin-resistant

Texto: The single envelope glycoprotein of vesicular stomatitis virus was
used as a specific probe of glycosyltransferase activities in
fibroblasts from two cystic fibrosis patients, an obligate
heterozygous carrier and a normal individual. Gel filtration of
pronase-digested glycopeptides from both purified virions and
infected cell-associated VSV glycoprotein which had been labeled
with[3H] glucosamine did not reveal any significant differences in
the glycosylation patterns between the different cell cultures. All 4
cell lines were apparently able to synthesize the mannose- and
glucosamine- containing core structure and branch chains terminating
in sialic acid which are characteristic of asparagine-linked
carbohydrate side chains in cellular glycoproteins. Analysis of
tryptic glycopeptides by anion-exchange chromotography indicated that
the same 2 major sites on the virus polypeptide were recognized and
glycosylated in all 4 VSV-infected cell cultures. These studies
suggest that the basic biochemical defect(s) in cystic fibrosis is
not an absence or deficiency in enzymes responsible for the
biosynthesis of complex carbohydrate side chains.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis is the most common form of chronic pulmonary disease
in the pediatric age group.  As these children survive longer with
improved therapy, the incidence of pneumothorax has increased.  In
our patients who were more than 10 years of age, the incidence of
pneumothorax was 12.5 percent.  We have reviewed the records of 22
patients who have had 44 episodes of pneumothorax complicating
cystic fibrosis.  In addition, our experience includes one child
with histiocytosis in whom pneumothorax was a serious complication.
One other pneumothorax occurred in a teen-age girl with apical
bullous disease.  A child who presents with even a minimal
pneumothorax complicating cystic fibrosis is at considerable risk of
developing an increasing lung collapse.  Even if the pneumothorax
resolves, there is a high risk of recurrence.  In children treated
with only a chest tube there was a 50 percent recurrence.
Consequently, we recommend a chest tube for any episode of
pneumothorax in a child with cystic fibrosis, with installation of a
sclerosing agent when the lung expands.  Three of our patients so
treated had no recurrence.  Children who have a persistent air leak
are confined to bed, retain secretions, and pursue a rapid downhill
course.  A more aggressive approach to these children, consisting of
thoracotomy, suture of the air leak, pteural symphysis, and
pulmonary lavage is feasible and the mortality rate is low.  A
pneumothorax in a child with no evidence of cystic fibrosis is a
rare event.  A persistent air leak is an indication for thoracotomy,
suture of the air leak, and lung biopsy.  Histiocytosis X is one
rare cause for this complication in children.

Anderson in 1938 although previously case reports had appeared in

flow-rate a tendency to lower RLA-values was detected. No significant

that RLA of sweat is up to 30 times higher than that of plasma, it is
concluded that RLA is probably released not from plasma but from the
sweat glands themselves, where it is stored or synthesized.

measured by 4pi-geometry whole body counting and related to the
amount of stainable diffuse cytoplasmatic non heme storage iron in
the bone marrow macrophages of children with cystic fibrosis. When
the storage iron was within the normal range (+/2+) children with
cystic fibrosis absorbed 10-38% (Xa+/-S.D.=21+/-9.3) of the oral
59Fe2+ dose which is identical with the 59Fe-absorption in normal
children with normal iron stores (9-45:23+/-8.7%). Depleted iron
stores caused an increase of 59Fe-absorption to 43-95% (Xa+/-
S.D.=62+/-19) in children with cystic fibrosis and to 45-100% (Xa+/-
S.D.=73+/-18) in control children. The interruption or continuation
of pancreatin maintenance therapy and the simultaneous administration
of 1-1.5 g pancreatin did not influence 59Fe2+ absorption in cystic
fibrosis. There is no evidence for a pancreatic factor required for
or inhibiting inorganic and food iron absorption in human beings.
Iron absorption is controlled also in cystic fibrosis chiefly by the
amounts of available storage iron. It is therefore not justified to
apprehend the development of hemosiderosis in children with cystic
fibrosis who are not or not sufficiently treated with pancreatin.

rectal epithelium from normal volunteers, patients with cystic
fibrosis, and their disease-free siblings were studied by
autoradiography of rectal biopsies pulse-labeled with 3H-glucosamine
and maintained in organ culture for various intervals of up to 24
hours. Human rectal goblet and columnar cells transported 3H-
glucosamine-labeled secretory products at a substantially slower rate
than do comparable colonic cells in smaller mammals. Within any one
biopsy sample, the movement of labeled mucus in goblet cells varied
widely among cells. Even with individual cells, labeled mucous
granules often did not move in concert toward the apical cell
surface. Average transport time in the cells of six cystic fibrosis
patients and six sibling controls did not differ significantly from
those of four adult controls. The carbohydrate composition of
glycoprotein secretions of rectal epithelial cells was investigated
by comparing autoradiographs of 3H-glucosamine-labeled biopsies with
those labeled with 3H-fucose, 3H-N-acetylmannosamine, and 35S-
sulfate. The patterns of incorporation of these four precrusors into
normal goblet and columnar cells suggested that both cell types may
alter the quantity and composition of newly synthesized glycoproteins
as they migrate, mature, and senesce. Incorporation patterns in
cystic fibrosis biopsies were indistinguishable from those of sibling
or adult controls. With the techniques used, no abnormalities of
epithelial glycoprotein production were detected in cystic fibrosis
rectal mucosa.

concentrations much higher than in any other milk sample tested at
this hospital in a large survey and higher than any we have seen in
the literature.  Milk of such high sodium content would be unsafe for
a baby, and we suggest that, if mothers with cystic fibrosis were to
breast feed, the sodium of the mild should be measured first.  The
breast, like so many other exocrine glands, seems to be affected by
the secretory abnormalities of cystic fibrosis.

C.F. heterozygosity in most cases.  We examined the sweat of 74
randomly selected children with respiratory asthma during the past 2
years, the sodium and chloride concentrations and bromide index being
determined.  Sodium and chloride concentrations in the sweat of the
asthma children were slightly but significantly higher (P < 0.05)
than those of the controls.  The difference in bromide index was even
more significant (P < 0.01).  This suggests that C.F. gene carriers
are unusually prevalent among children with bronchial asthma.  One
possibility is that enhanced ion loss in various diseases with
allergic pathological mechanisms is secondary in nature.  However,
this seems unlikely since in our material high sweat-electrolyte
concentrations were observed in only a proportion of control children
whose illness was similar in severity to that of the asthmatic
children, and normal sweat values were obtained even when the child's
condition was very serious.

Texto: In a new method of testing stool samples from newborn babies for
cystic fibrosis (C.F.), a colourless substrate, benzoyl-arginine-p-
nitroanilide (B.A.P.N.A.), releases yellow p-nitroaniline when
hydrolysed by trypsin. Samples from infants with C.F., who lack
trypsin, give negligible colour. 2 infants with C.F. were detected
among 2500 consecutive newborn babies tested. The incidence of false-
positive results was 1.2% after the first specimen and 0.05% after
the second specimen. A further refinement has reduced the positive
rate to 0.1% after the first specimen (2000 samples). Tests on
samples from 5 other older patients with untreated C.F. have yielded
no evidence for false-negative results.

Texto: Laboratory diagnosis of malabsorption syndromes in children is more
difficult for obvious reasons involving the collection of specimens.
The early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is extremely urgent, since
the disease is treatable.  The standard test is the sweat test.
Over 99 percent of patients with this disease will have elevation of
sodium and chloride in the sweat.  Three tests are used to assess
pancreatic function.  First is the measurement of stool trypsin and
chymotrypsin.  Second, stimulation with hormones - the standard
secretin and CCK tests.  A third procedure tests carbohydrate
tolerance, an increasingly important test since an ever-growing
number of patients in late childhood and early adulthood with cystic
fibrosis are being found to have diabetes mellitus.  The commonest
and most important hereditary disease that affects pancreatic
function is cystic fibrosis.  The commonest form of pancreatic
insufficiency in childhood is mucoviscidosis or cystic fibrosis of
the pancreas.  The incidence of this disease is approximately one
per 1000 live births.  It occurs in all races, and the defect is
transmitted as an autosomal recessive.  The classic features are
frequent bowel movements with the characteristic appearance of
steatorrheic stools, and a failure to grow and develop normally.

various ages from birth to 28 years. Some patients were diagnosed
late in life in spite of classical symptoms and a characteristic

we compared biliary lipid composition in 26 patients with cystic

cholecystograms, and only one had gallstones. In 14 patients with
cystic fibrosis who had stopped taking pancreatic enzymes for one

cystic fibrosis taking pancreatic enzymes, molar percentage of
cholesterol (8.6 +/- 1.7) and saturation index (1.0 +/- 0.1) did not
differ from those of controls; in cystic fibrosis there was a
preponderance of cholic over chenodeoxycholic acid both off (1.7 +/-

Texto: Using a modified rabbit tracheal bioassay, we have confirmed that
serum from individuals with bronchial asthma and serum from
homozygotes and heterozygotes for CF cause ciliary dyskinesia,
whereas normal healthy control sera do not.  To evaluate the
specificity of the ciliary dyskinesia activity (CDA) detected, we
bioassayed serum from eight patients with bronchial asthma.  We
found that all eight asthmatic sera caused a ciliary dyskinesia
reaction; however, sera from asthmatics generally caused a
subsequent ciliostasis (cessation of ciliary beating).  Concurrent
evaluation of all sera for CDA by bioassay and for cystic fibrosis
protein (CFP) by electrofocusing showed that all CDA-positive sera
except seven of the eight asthmatic sera were also positive for CFP
(our specific marker for the CF gene).  These two finding indicated
that the activity detected in patients with asthma and other
respiratory diseases could be a substance different from a
CF-specific CDF.  To test our hypothesis, we set out to purify the
CDAs in asthmatic, CF homozygote and OHCF sera.  Representative
results clearly indicate that the asthmatic CDA is found in DEAE-II
and Sephadex G-200 Fraction II, whereas the CDA found in CF and OHCF
sera elutes in DEAE-I and Sephadex G-200 Fractions III and IV (weak
CDA).  We conclude that the CDAs in asthma and CF are distinct
substances.  Our findings may facilitate purification of what we
feel is a CF-specific CDF from CF and OHCF serum.  Purification is a
prerequisite to elucidating the exact nature of this substance and
its role in the pathophysiology of CF.

Texto: We have developed a modified rabbit tracheal bioassay for use in
investigating a possible correlation between cystic fibrosis protein
(CFP) and ciliary dyskinesia factor (CDF) in human serum. The
bioassay requires high standards of tissue selection, and all
epithelial tissue must be free of underlying connective tissue. When
serum samples were collected and processed carefully and warmed to 37
degrees before assay, CDF could be reliably detected in 31 of 31 sera
from cystic fibrosis (CF) homozygotes or obligate heterozygotes in 35
min or less without prior fractionation or concentration of sera,
whereas 13 of 14 normal control sera were nonreactive. CDF-positive
serum reacts in three consecutive phases: (1) initial increase in
ciliary beat frequency, (2) ciliary dyskinesia, and (3) tissue
destruction with extrusion of single ciliated cells, mucus, and
debris. Our results confirm the association of CDF with cystic
fibrosis. The bioassay is not specific for CF, however, when whole
sera are bioassayed, since serum from several patients with bronchial
asthma also caused ciliary dyskinesia. However, this finding need not
preclude using rabbit tracheal ciliated epithelial tissue as an assay
for following the purification of CDF. Isoelectric focusing showed
that the presence or absence of CFP corresponded with that of
dyskinesia activity in all sera tested except for the active samples
from seven asthma patients, which were negative for CFP. The results
indicate that CFP and CDF may be identical or closely related markers
for the CF gene, and suggest that the activity detected by the rabbit
tracheal bioassay in sera from patients with asthma and other
diseases probably is caused by a substance different from a CF-
specific CDF.

Smith et al., we suggested several possible reasons for the
inability of Thomas et al. and other investigators to detect cystic
fibrosis protein (CFP) using electrofocusing techniques.  Thomas and
coworkers communicated with us for the purpose of determining
possible reasons for their inability to detect CFP by
electrofocusing.  Key points made during these conversations are
reiterated below in a firm attempt to alleviate future problems by
inexperienced investigators in their attempts to use analytic
electrofocusing to detect CFP.  In our communications with Thomas

analyzed the samples they screened by either using the equipment of
Awdeh et al. or employing our standardized procedure.  It is unknown
whether or not they exercised the requirements for serum sample
collection, processing, and storage.  We feel the above reasons are
sufficient to explain the reported failure of Thomas et al. to
reproduce our results and to detect consistently a CFP in sera from
individuals with the CF gene.

polyacrylamide gels (IEFAG) method specified by Wilson et al. in our
laboratory.  Since the resolution obtained with their procedure
appeared to be inadequate for identifying single protein bands in the
relevant region, we have incorporated several methodologic
improvements into the isoelectric focusing technique.  These
improvements have significantly enhanced the resolution and have thus
enabled us to demonstrate a greater degree of heterogeneity of serum
gamma-globulins than is visible in the paper of Wilson et al.
Despite the significant increase in the number of bands resolved by
our method, a difference among CF, heterozygote, and control sera in
the pH 8.4 - 8.5 region could not be detected.  In addition, the
two-step IEFAG/disc electrophoresis technique of Altland et al. has
been tested in our laboratory.  We have also modified this analytic
procedure, enabling the fractionation of several small proteins from
a portion of the IgG fraction.  Again, despite an improvement in
resolution which reveals more heterogeneity, no unique protein has
been observed consistently in the CF and heterozygote area.

Texto: Elevated calcium and protein concentration are a consistent
abnormality in submaxillary saliva from patients with cystic fibrosis
(CF) and from experimental animal models developed by the chronic
administration of either isoproterenol (IPR) or reserpine. The
possibility that the effects of the two drugs may be additive was
investigated by assessing their combined effects on glandular and
salivary C++ and protein in the rat submaxillary gland. Individually,
their effects were also assessed in relation to the dose used.
Results indicate that: (1) treatment for 7 days with 0.05, 0.50, and
5.0 mg/kg daily dose of reserpine caused, respectively, a 45%, 95%,
and 120% increase in glandular Ca++ and a 9.3%, 16.5%, and 37.4%
increase in glandular protein; (2) treatment for 7 days with a 5.0
mg/kg daily dose of isoproterenol caused a 138% increase in gland
Ca++ and a 12.38% increase in gland protein. Treatment with a 5.0
mg/rat daily dose of this drug caused increases of 166% and 10.3% in
gland Ca++ and protein; (3) in experiments involving a combination of
the two drugs, isoproterenol was administered in a 5.0 mg/kg daily
dose from days 1-7 and reserpine in a 0.5 mg/kg daily dose from days
4-10 of the treatment schedule. This procedure resulted in (a) a 217%
increase in gland Ca++ and a 25.7% increase in gland protein; (b) a
marked accumulation of a granular, basophilic material in acinar
cells and the development of intraductal precipitates; (c) the
secretion of turbid saliva with high Ca++ and protein concentrations
after a secretory dose of isoproterenol (this type of stimulation
also reduced the gland Ca++ (50%) and protein (20%) contents and
produced vacuolization in the acinar cells); (d) the secretion of
saliva with elevated Ca++ and protein in response to pilocarpine
(these elevated concentrations were, however, one-fifth of those
obtained after isoproterenol stimulation); (e) the secretion of
smaller volume of saliva after both types of stimulation. These
findings indicate that both IPR and reserpine have a dose-related and
significant effect on submaxillary gland Ca++ and protein and that
their individual effects are synergistic. The implications of this
synergism for the physiologic state of the submaxillary gland and for
the secretory abnormality of cystic fibrosis are discussed.

methionine activity and putrescine concentration was apparent in all
cell lines. A putrescine concentration of 0.8 mM was optimal for
enhancement of SAM decarboxylase activity. The passage number of the
cell line correlated inversely with maximal putrescine-stimulated SAM
decarboxylase activity, earlier passage numbers having the highest
specific activity (Fig. 1). No significant differences in basal or
putrescine-stimulated SAM decarboxylase activity were noted between
normal fibroblast cultures and cells from patients with cystic

lines approached confluence. Activity was lowest during exponential
growth (Fig. 3). ODC activity was increased during early exponential
growth and fell as cells reached confluence (Fig. 4). No differences

Texto: We have developed an improved method for the detection of cystic
fibrosis protein (CFP). The method employs the LKB Multiphor to
electrofocus whole serum, instead of the apparatus used in previous
studies. Two basic modifications were necessary: (1) a pH 2.5--10.0
gradient instead of a pH 5--10 gradient, and (2) constant power for
focusing the serum proteins instead of constant voltage. The first
modification ensured adequate dissolution of the CFP-IgG complexes
(or other precursor complexes which may liberate CFP). The second
modification ensured a linear gradient (between pH 3.8 and pH 9.2),
excellent resolution in the pH 8--9 region, and the separation of CFP
within 2 hr without overheating of the gel. Electrofocusing with the
LKB Multiphor permits the detection of CFP in as many as 24 serum
samples per gel. Results obtained from the analysis of 31 cystic
fibrosis, 28 obligate heterozygote carrier, and 28 normal control
sera indicate that CFP can be reproducibly and accurately detected in
sera using the LKB Multiphor.

two inbred strains of mice with some hereditary alterations
resembling cystic fibrosis (CF).  These mice were mice with abnormal
electrolyte metabolism (DBA/@J-cri), mice with spontaneous
pneumonitis (C57BL/6J-bg), and mice without any CF-like alterations
(BALB/c).  The methods used to produce pulmonary infection were
essentially those of Laurenzi and associates adapted as needed for
mutant mice.  The animals mentioned above were exposed to a finely
divided aerosol suspension of a coagulase-positive strain of S.
aureus in phosphate buffer.  Immediately after the exposure, half of
the animals were killed, and the remaining half were killed 4 hr
later.  In each experimental unit the mice killed immediately after
the exposure were as similar as possible to the mice killed 4 hr
later with respect to genotype, age, and sex; some were siblings.
The uncleared bacteria (UBR) in 4 hr were 0.20 for the mice without
any CF-like alterations (BALB/c) and the C57BL/6J-bg, bg/bg
genotypes; 0.28 for C57BL/6J-bg, +/? genotypes; 0.50 for the
DBA/2J-cri, +/? genotypes; and 0.56 for cri/cri mice.  The number of
viable staphylococci found immediately after the aerosol exposure
(Co) in the C57BL/6J-bg strain is significantly lower than the Co of
the BALB/c (P < 0.05) and DBA/2J-cri strain (P < 0.01).  The latter
two did not differ from each other.  There was no sex difference
with respect to the UBR and Co data.  The DBA/2J-cri strain of mice,
where the cri mutation first appeared, has a decreased capacity for
clearance of S. aureus by the lung.  Together with the other CF-like
alterations of the cri mutation, namely failure for the reabsorption
of Na+ by the parotid duct, high level of Na+ in the fur, and CF
abnormal serum factor activity in the serum of the cri/cri mice, we
suggest that the cribriform degeneration mouse mutant may provide a
potential animal model for studying CF.  The finding of a mouse
mutation with electrolyte alterations and CF-like abnormal serum
activity, simialr to the activity found in CF children, in an inbred
strain of mice with a decreased bacterial clearance by the lungs,
makes these mice very useful for CF studies.

Texto: This study utilized isoelectric focusing and electrophoresis in an
attempt to detect a cystic fibrosis (CF) serum factor(s), for which
there is considerable indirect evidence.  The method of isoelectric
focusing in polyacrylamide gels (IEFAG) specified by Wilson et al.
(53), as reproduced in our laboratory, did not enable the detection
of a CF factor protein reported to focus near pH 8.4-8.5.
Consequently, we employed our modified IEFAG techniques, which
enabled us to demonstrate significantly enhanced resolution and
striking heterogeneity in serum gamm-globulins.  Despite the
significant increase in the number of bands resolved by our methods,
neither a difference at pH 8.4-8.5 nor other differences throughout
the alkaline pH range could be detected consistently in the CF and
heterozygous sera.  The two-step IEFAG/disc electrophoresis
technique outline by Altland et al. (2), as reproduced in our
laboratory, indicated that at least one small, cationic protein
could be fractioned from all serum samples.  Improvements in the
method of disc electrophoresis resulted in the observation of
numerous bands from some samples and of differences among the
samples, but no protein band unique to the CF genotypes was
observed.  Our approach, employing different electrophoresis
techniques and varying the conditions of sample analysis, should
have increased the likelihood of detecting a protein or proteins
specific for the CF genotypes.  Despite the many variations in our
approach, no consistently unique protein was observed in the CF or
heterozygous sera.  A CF serum factor cannot be readily demonstrated
by the electrophoretic techniques described.  The value of the
"biophysical assay" and the "nonbiologic technique" reported in the
literature is suspect, and the promise and applicability of these
techniques as diagnostic tests for the CF gene should be carefully

Texto: Purified serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), derived from eight cystic
fibrosis (CF) and five carrier subjects, has been shown to be
responsible for the mucociliary disturbances noted in the rabbit
tracheal bioassay. A small molecular substance of less than 10,000
but greater than 1,000 daltons (by Amicon filtration) was found
associated with gamma-globulin fractions isolated from sera of these
same cystic patients and their parents. Once separated by PM-10
ultrafiltration, this small substance was unable to promote the
ciliary dyskinesia response in eight of eight CF and five of five CF
carrier individuals unless pooled purified human IgG was added. In
addition, the IgG-rich fraction retained by PM-10 ultrafiltration was
still able to promote the ciliary dyskinesia response in the
bioassay, an event noted in our earlier work with whole serum. The
size of the small serum substance and its association with IgG
closely corresponds to that described for the oyster test system, as
well as to that produced by cultured cells derived from homozygotes
and heteroxygotes for this genetic disorder. The persistence of the
ability to promote mucociliary disturbances by the IgG-rich retentate
PM-10 fractions may be indicative of the ineffective molecular
separation by the Amicon ultransfiltration apparatus or may represent
another CF-related, IgG-associated substance not influenced by
ultrafiltration. Speculation The genetic disturbance of CF can be
explained by the presence of a molecule(s) which has an affinity for
IgG, which in turn gives rise to the various physiologic facets of
this disorder. This molecule(s) is present in CF only because of a
deficiency of an enzyme which normally controls its level by
inactivation.

individuals with bronchial asthma have been partially purified.
Concurrently, the CDA's in sera from patients with cystic fibrosis

exchange or gel permeation chromatographic procedures. Sephadex G-200
chromatography indicated that the CF-CDA eluted with a protein
fraction of molecular weight (MW) 68,000-150,000 and that the asthma
CDA was found in a protein fraction of MV greater than 150,000. The
two activities could also be separated by DEAE-cellulose
chromatography. Prior acidification of whole normal, CF homozygote,
obligate heterozygote, or asthmatic sera to pH 3.7 using EDTA,
followed by fractionation of Sephadex G-200 removed all the CDA's
from fractions of highermolecular  weight and shifted the activities
to a protein fraction of MW 1,100-13,700. This procedure afforded a
200-fold purification of the CDA's in sera from patients with asthma
or CF. EDTA treatment, however, also generated a CDA in previously
nonreactive normal sera. Subsequent fractionation of the various
active G-200 fractions on Bio-Gel P10 allowed for the separation of
three separate activities (Bio-Gel Fractions I, II-IV, and V).
Fraction I was shown to represent the activity in sera from patients
with asthma and was determined to be C3a (MW 9,000). Fraction I was
also found in normal, CF, and carrier sera and therefore is not a
specific CDA. Fraction II-IV is thought to represent a CF-specific
CDA (MW 5,000) since it could not be demonstrated in either normal or
asthmatic sera but was found in sera of obligate heterozygotes.
Fraction III-IV also did not react with antisera to human C3a.
Fraction V was generated from all serum types upon acidification of
the serum with EDTA and is thought to be a nonspecific CDA. Bio-Gel
P10 filtration of Sephadex G-200 fractions provided 823-fold and 650-
fold purification of the asthmatic and CF CDA's, respectively.
Concurrent analysis of column fractions for CDA's by bioassay and for
CFP by electrofocusing showed CFP only in fractions that contained
the CF-CDA. Combined analyses employing acid disc gel
electrophoresis, isoelectric focusing, and EDTA treatment of active
CF-immunoglobulin (Ig) G and Sephadex G-200 column fractions,
followed by Bio-Gel P10 chromatography, provided evidence that CFP
was associated with the CF-CDA. It is unknown as yet whether CFP
itself is responsible for the CF-CDA activity.

ultrastructurally in the cultured fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis
patients, obligatory heterozygotes, and normal individuals by
peroxidase labeling technique. Con A binding sites were localized as
a continuous layer on the external side of the plasma membrane in
fixed fibroblasts of the three genotypes. In living cells, Con A
induces both lateral and vertical movements of binding sites as
expressed by cap formation and internalization of the plasma
membrane. Fibroblasts of the three genotypes responded similarly to
Con A treatment and failed to show significant detectable
differences.

Texto: Simultaneous red blood cell (RBC) and plasma volume determinations
were obtained in 16 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and moderately
severe pulmonary involvement. Hypervolemia with an increase in both
RBC and plasma volumes was observed. Changes in blood volume were
marked when values were indexed by weight but less significant when
indexed by height. Decreasing systemic arterial oxygen saturation was
associated with a progressive increase in RBC mass, hematocrit value,
and hemoglobin level and a decrease in mean corpuscular hemoglobin
concentration. RBC and total blood volumes were highest in patients
with cor pulmonale and congestive heart failure. However, the
compensatory polycythemic response in patients with CF was inadequate
when compared with the response to hypoxemia in patients with
cyanotic congenital heart disease. The insufficient oxygen-carrying
capacity may compromise tissue oxygen delivery and necessitate
treatment.

liver on the initial roentgenograms in newly diagnosed cases of
cystic fibrosis was 4%.  The cause of fatty infiltration of the
liver in cystic fibrosis is not clear; however, the basis is most
likely a nutritional deficiency in protein.

Texto: Amikacin, a new semisynthetic aminoglycoside antibiotic with activity
against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, was used to treat 22 acute
exacerbations of chronic pulmonary infections in 18 patients with
cystic fibrosis. Patients ranged from 5 to 32 years of age and had
mucoid P. aeruginosa isolated from sputum. The amikacin dose was
usually 7.5 mg/kg every eight hours but was increased to 10 mg/kg
and/or carbenicillin was added in selected cases depending on
clinical course. Although P. aeruginosa was not eliminated from our
patients' sputum except in two cases, there was a good clinical
response in 19 of 22 courses. Significant improvement in chest x-ray
films, spirometry, or arterial oxygen tension was documented in 11 of
17 courses. One instance of serum creatinine level elevation could
not be attributed to this antibiotic. Two patients showed minimal (15
dB) unilateral high-frequency hearing loss on serial audiograms.
Activity against many gentamicin-resistant strains and high blood
levels are among the attractive properties of amikacin. Amikacin is
clinically effective in treating Pseudomonas-associated pulmonary
infections complicating cystic fibrosis.

Texto: A noninvasive, radionuclide imaging technique for measuring the rate
of mucus clearance in the trachea (RT), was used to study
gravitational effects on mucus clearance in 13 patients with cystic
fibrosis (CF), average age 17 years; 7 normal, nonsmoking adults,
average age 26 years; and a normal subject who was recovering from an
acute upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). In the upright
position, nine of the CF patients and the subject with URTI
demonstrated abnormal tracheal mucus clearance which approached
normal when they were placed in 25 degrees headdown position. The
normal subjects and two of the CF patients showed no significant
difference in the RT measured in the two positions. The results of
the study indicate that the force of gravity can be a major influence
on tracheal mucus clearance in CF and URTI subjects. This conclusion
supports the use of postural drainage as an effective form of therapy
in patients with cystic fibrosis.

Texto: Jejunal biopsy specimens were obtained from children with cystic
fibrosis (CF), celiac disease (CD), or congenital exocrine
pancreatic hypoplasia (CEPH) and from control subjects.  Sections
were examined histologically and homogenates were used for
measurement of enterokinase and sucrase activities.  This work was
undertaken because enterokinase is considered a brush border enzyme,
the release of which into the intestinal lumen is influenced by
pancreatic enzymes, and also because we have recently shown a small
bowel mucosal dysfunction in patients with CF.  As expected, sucrase
activity was reduce (p < .05) in children with CD as compared to the
other three groups.  On the other hand, enterokinase activity in
children with pancreatic insufficiency (CF and CEPH) was higher (p <
.05) than that of control subjects.  The present study has shown
that in patients with CF and CEPH, mucosal enterokinase activity was
increased as compared to control subjects.  It seems that the
pancreatic enzymes play a large role in the turnover of enzymes in
the brush border membrane and that the observed increase of mucosal
enterokinase activity is probably explained by a reduced degradation
in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis of the pancreas is a recessively inherited disorder
generally considered to result in chronic pulmonary or digestive
symptoms.  Therefore, it may not be readily appreciated that this
disease can also present with anemia, edema, and hypoproteinemia,
especially in infants taking breast milk or soy-based formulas.  The
following example involving monozygotic twins given cow's milk
formula since birth will serve to illustrate this association.

Texto: A study of 35 patients with cystic fibrosis demonstrated that
increasing severity of pulmonary involvement was associated with a
mild but definite increase in erythrocyte 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-
DPG) and a decrease in hemoglobin affinity for oxygen. The
predominant regulators of 2,3-DPG were blood pH, cardiac output, and
systemic oxygen transport. No significant relationship was observed
between erythrocyte 2,3-DPG content and arterial oxygen tension.
Hypophosphatemia may have prevented a greater increase in erythrocyte
2,3-DPG content. The inadequate increase in 2,3-DPG and consequent
insufficient change in hemoglobin-oxygen affinity, coupled with an
insufficient compensatory erythrocytic response, may adversely affect
tissue oxygenation in patients with severe cystic fibrosis.

indicated a deficiency in essential fatty acids (EFA). In view of a
report that intravenous administration of soybean oil emulsions
normalized sweat sodium values in CF children, we studied the effects
of orally administered essential fatty acids (as corn oil) for one
year. Some improvement was noted in all patients, but no one
consistent factor predominated. However, arachidonic acid, which was
found only in trace amounts or was absent in sera of all children
with CF before the clinical trial, was increased significantly in the
sera after the oral administration of EFA for one year. Other
findings included a significant decrease in sweat sodium and T3 in
most patients.

cystic fibrosis, is reported. Personality testing of the parents
showed that 32% of the fathers and 22% of the mothers obtained scores
in the range suggestive of emotional disturbance. The Family-Concept
O Sort assessment of family interaction indicated that the primary
effect of having a child with cystic fibrosis was in terms of
decreased family satisfaction and family adjustment. The results do
not support previous estimates of an increased incidence of emotional
disturbance in children with cystic fibrosis. Evidence for negative
psychological impact of chronic illness on sibling development was
also lacking. Future research would benefit from a focus on the
strengths and resilience of children with cystic fibrosis and their
families.

Texto: Respiratory infections in infants and children cause much ill-health
and also an appreciable mortality.  They are found at times in most
school-children and in infants, especially those in large families
and those living in poor circumstances.  In all respiratory
infections the whole respiratory tract is involved.  For descriptive
purposes it is useful to divide these infections into upper
respiratory-tract infections, in which the infection is
predominantly at the larynx or above; and lower respiratory-tract
infections, in which the predominant infection is below the larynx.
Acute upper respiratory-tract infections are usually viral and the
poly-virus infection of coryza is the commonest.  Acute lower
respiratory-tract infections are discussed in two groups: in infants
under two years of age and in children over two (including cystic
fibrosis).

Texto: The three patients described here have all been seen recently at the
Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh, and each has
presented a diagnostic problem.  In the three cases presented it has
been difficult to establish the true diagnosis.  In the first case,
symptoms compatible with the diagnostic criteria of Beumont and his
colleagues were directly the result of a slow-growing cerebral
neoplasm which was elusive to diagnose.  The second patient, a boy
with cystic fibrosis, showed symptoms strongly suggestive of
anorexia nervosa and responded to dietary measures without
pancreatic enzyme replacement.  We have been unable to demonstrate
any organic disease in the third case and, hence, a presumptive
diagnosis of anorexia nervosa has been made.  It remains to be said
that this condition is extremely rare in boys and that anorexia with
weight loss warrants extremely thorough investigation.

different exocrine systems.

Texto: We demonstrate previously that fibroblasts from cystic fibrosis (CF)
patients are significantly more resistant to the toxic effects of
ouabain than normal human fibroblasts are. Ouabain is generally
assumed to act primarily at the level of the cell membrane and to
cause killing of cells by inhibiting ion transport. We have therefore
examined the ability of normal and CF cells to survive exposure to
ethacrynic acid, another inhibitor of ion transport, and to survive
colchicine and aminopterin, resistance to which has been associated
with membrane alterations in other cells. The effect of
dexamethasone, which has a sterol nucleus similar to that of ouabain
but is thought to have a different site of cellular action, was also
tested. Exposure of the cells to ethacrynic acid, colchicine, or
aminopterin did not reveal any differences in survival between normal
and CF fibroblasts. However, CF cells survived exposure to
dexamethasone significantly better than normal cells did. These
results suggest that normal and CF cells do not differ in terms of a
generalized resistance to ion transport inhibitors or to drugs that
must pass through the membrane to be active. Instead, the results
raise the possibility that CF cells have an enhanced resistance to
drugs that have the sterol nucleus found in ouabain and
dexamethasone.

Texto: Diploid skin fibroblasts derived from several unrelated patients with
cystic fibrosis (CF) were tested for resistance to the cytotoxic
effects of ouabain in comparison with cells from normal individuals.
Cells from CF and normal individuals were plated at low density and
exposed to ouabain at different concentrations for 24 hr. Dose-
response curves showed that CF cells survived significantly better
than did normal cells at all ouabain concentrations from 0.1 nM to 1
micronM in potassium-deficient medium. In medium containing the usual
amount of potassium (6.25 mM), survival of the CF cells exposed to
ouabain was decreased to that of the normal cells. If the glucose
concentration of the potassium-deficient medium was decreased to 10%
of the usual amount, the resistance of the CF cells to ouabain
disappeared and their survival was identical to that of the normal
cells. These findings may be useful in understanding the biochemical
basis of CG and its clinical manifestations.

Texto: Has too much attention been focused on antibiotic therapy in cystic
fibrosis, thereby overshadowing other measures which have led to the
improved prognosis?  This may well be true and there is no doubt
that regular intensive physiotherapy, performed daily by the
patients' relatives, plays the major part in improving airway
obstruction.  More skilful nutritional management including adequate
pancreatic replacement therapy and high-energy, high-protein diets
will also have had beneficial effects on the respiratory defects.
The infected CF patient may not require high doses of antibiotics;
he too might benefit more from simple nutritional alterations.  It
is not new to suggest that nutritional factors are important
influences on the resistance to infection of the CF patient.  What
we can now do is measure the different aspects of the immune
response in such patients and those with malnutrition, so that the
simplest and most direct therapy can be chosen.

Texto: The present study was initiated to determine the antibody response
to lipoprotein of patients with various enterobacterial infections.
This investigation was also considered important because patients
with these infections respond differently to another antigen common
to enterobacteriaceae, the common enterobacterial antigen.
Included were 33 patients with cystic fibrosis, complicated by
enterobacterial respiratory tract infection.  The lipoprotein (LP)
antibody levels of healthy subjects and of patients with varied
enterobacterial infections were determined.  None of the healthy
children and only one of the healthy adults had antibodies against
LP.  In contrast, 18% of the children with peritonitis complicating
appendicitis, 24% of patients with enterobacterial infection of the
respiratory tract complicating cystic fibrosis, and 42% of adult
subjects with bacteremia complicating malignancy, had LP antibodies
in the serum.  The reason for these striking differences in the
immune response to this common antigen remains to be elucidated.

Texto: The aim of the present study is to elucidate the correlation between
etiology and histology in nasal polyps with special regard to cystic
fibrosis (CF). Nasal polyps from 15 children with CF and a control
group of non-CF polyps from 15 adult patients were examined by light-
microscopy. The histological evaluation was carried out on a blind
basis in order to avoid bias. Among the parameters used, the tissue
eosinophilia proved to be the most valuable factor in the
differentiation between CF and non-CF polyps, as only few eosinophils
were found in the CF-polyps. The polyp glands were few and generally
pathological. Some characteristics abnormalities in the grandular
morphology are apparently more common in CF polyps. It is concluded,
that the histological examination of nasal polyps is of importance
for the correct classification of the patient, but the diagnosis of
CF cannot be made based on microscopy of polyps. Further studies
including blinded histological examination of nasal polypous tissue
might contribute to a more differentiated diagnose of nasal
polyposis.

of cystic fibrosis which involves placing the patient on an electric
blanket and wrapping him warmly for 2 - 5 hours until profuse
sweating has occurred for 30 minutes.  One important omission from
the title and the abstract is any mention of safety.  Children with
cystic fibrosis may develop heat prostration when exposed to high
temperatures, which may cause massive sodium and chloride losses via
the sweat.  This could occur with the method described.  The
apparatus described by Gibson and Cooke in the classic pilocarpine
iontophoresis method of collecting sweat is neither overly
sophisticated nor expensive.  It remains the method of choice,

Texto: Cystic fibrosis (C.F.) is a serious genetic disorder occurring
mainly among the Whites and starting in early childhood or even at
birth.  The name is a shortening of the old term Cystic Fibrosis (or
Fibrocystic disease) of the pancreas.  This comes from the
historical appearance at post-mortem first described by Landsteiner
in 1905.  It was only in 1938 that Dorothee Anderson and Fanconi
realised that the disease was a separate entity and not simply a
manifestation of other illnesses.  Another name is Mucoviscidosis
which gives a clue as to one of the most important features of the
disease.  Mucus formed is thicker and stickier (more viscid) than
normal and tends to clog up the bronchi and ducts, particularly the
pancreatic ducts.  Chronic bronchitis with recurrent severe
infection and malabsorption are the main symptoms of the disease.
The other important abnormality is an increased amount of sodium
chloride (salt) in the sweat.  This fact, used in the diagnosis, was
first realised during a heat wave in New York in 1953 when it was
noticed that most of the children with heat prostration suffered
from C.F.  Little is known of the causes of the abnormalities of
sweat and mucus.  Some generalised cell abnormality (? enzymatic)
seems possible.  There is no doubt that the condition is genetically
transmitted and most evidence favours a recessive mode of
inheritance.

the isoenzymes of human amylase in health and disease as well as
physico-chemical differences between individual isoamylases.  In
cystic fibrosis determination of serum isoamylase is of value,
although absence of pancreatic serum isoamylase is a normal finding
during the first year of life.  Demonstrable pancreatic serum
isoamylase in such early life argues against the diagnosis.  After
one year of age the test has a positive diagnostic value.

Texto: A total of 133 patients with cystic fibrosis have been followed for
up to 5 years with monthly examinations including bacteriological
examinations of sputum. Sera from the patients were examined by means
of crossed immunoelectrophoresis for the occurence and number of
precipitating antibody specificites against Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
Poor prognosis in cystic fibrosis was associated with chronic
colonization (9 months - more than 5 years) of the respiratory tract
with mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and with an onset of the chronic
colonization before puberty. Among the patients with chronic
Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization, poor prognosis was associated
with high numbers of precipitins against antigens from these bacteria
(up to 61). The number of Pseudomonas aeruginosa precipitins
increased on an average with five per year in chronically colonized
patients. Rapidly increasing number of precipitins was associated
with poor prognosis. Patients with any degree of impairment of the
ventilatory function and any changes on the chest radiographs could
contract chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization. Poor
ventilatory function and severe changes on the chest radiographs was
associated with high numbers of Pseudomonas aeruginosa precipitins
and with poor prognosis. Although many O groups of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa were found in the chronically colonized group of patients,
53% of the patients harboured strains belonging to O group 3 or 3/9,
and the highest numbers of precipitins were found in serum from these
patients.

Texto: Abnormalities of Hageman factor dependent pathways have been
described in a wide variety of human disease states. Congenital
deficiencies of factor XII (Hageman trait) prekallikrein (Fletcher
trait) and high molecular weight kininogen (Williams, Fitzgerald and
Flaujeac traits) although resulting in profound in vitro changes, do
not cause in vivo difficulties. In contrast, deficiency of C1
esterase inhibitor (hereditary angioedema) results in significant
morbidity and mortality. Acquired diseases may exhibit decreased
synthesis of these three proteins in cirrhosis and dengue fever. In
vivo activation of factor XII initiated pathways occur in septic
shock, disseminated or localized intravascular coagulation, typhoid
fever, polycythemia vera, hyperbetalipoproteinemia, coronary artery
disease, nephrotic syndrome, transfusion reactions, hemodialysis and
extracorporeal bypass. Activation of both the intrinsic system and
tissue mediators contribute to the vasomotor phenomena in carcinoid
syndrome and postgastrectomy dumping. Roles for factor XII,
prekallikrein and kininogen have been suggested in gouty arthritis,
allergic disorders and cystic fibrosis but the evidence is not yet
convincing in these disorders.

failure to thrive, hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, high serum
aldosterone values, and who was found to have cystic fibrosis.
Children with cystic fibrosis have moderately elevated plasma renin
and secondarily elevated serum aldosterone value.  This is due to
chronic sodium chloride loss through sweat.  Our patient had high
serum aldosterone values associated with only slightly elevated
serum cortisol value.  High  serum aldosterone value increased
further despite correcting conditions which stimulate aldosterone
secretion.  This suggests that long-standing salt depletion is not
the only cause for abnormal renin-aldosterone system.

etioloical factors of neuroaxonal dystrophy (N.D.) in brainstem and
spinal cord of children with various non-neurological diseases.  The
materials used in this study consisted of 266 consecutive autopsies
from 1974-1976 and an additional 13 cases from previous years.  By
far, the most common cause of N.D. in children was chemotherapeutic
drugs, particularly vincristine, used for the treatment of malignant
tumors.  Approximately 90% of these children developed N.D. and the
changes ranged from mild to severe.  Approximately two-thirds of
children with cystic fibrosis, congestive heart failure and chronic
renal failure developed N.D. and the changes were mostly mild.  Only
one-third of patients with congenital biliary atresia and
malnutrition developed N.D. and the changes were always mild.  The
frequency and severity of N.D. increased in patients who had
prolonged clinical courses; no N.D. was seen in patients who died
from acute cases such as trauma, acute infection, intoxication,
acute renal failure or prematurity.  This type of N.D. may be
considered as reactive to a wide variety of injurious factors such
as drug toxicity, malnutrition, chronic hypoxia and chronic renal
failure, either alone or in combination.  In contrast to previous
reports of a low incidence of N.D. in children, there has been a
sharp increase in recent years due to the advent of chemotherapy.

seen from January 1956 to June 1976, it is demonstrated that the
relative underweight (weight loss corrected for height) is most

degree of underweight closely correlates inversely with survival.
Because of its prognostic value, it is recommended that this clinical

Texto: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) have an increased concentration of
sodium in their nails. Hitherto, only neutron activation analysis has
been considered for the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis by analysis of
electrolytes in nails. It has been thoroughly tested methodologically
and clinically. However, the intrinsic advantages of X-ray
microanalysis and the results obtained in this study suggest that
this method, after further testing, may be a useful diagnostic acid
for cystic fibrosis. In comparison with neutron activation analysis,
X-ray microanalysis has the advantage of simultaneously giving the
concentrations of several elements and may be accessible at any
hospital with an electron microscope fitted with the necessary
equipment. Nails of CF-patients are here shown to have increased
concentrations of Na, K and Cl, which will make the diagnosis of
cystic fibrosis more reliable. The possibility of using sulphur as a
reference element may eliminate the weighing procedure necessary in
neutron activation analysis.

most common type of cystic fibrosis (CF) can be reliably diagnosed
with skin-derived fibroblast cultures. Alkaline phosphatase (AIP)

and 6 CF-homozygotes before and after stimulation with Tamm-Horsfall-

and 34.6 for the three different genotypes respectively. There was no
overlap between the values of CF-homozygotes on the one hand, and the
values of CF-heterozygotes and normal controls on the other hand. All
24 specimens were correctly diagnosed in the present double blind
study, indicating the very high degree of reliability of the THP-
induction test in the detection of the predominant type of cystic
fibrosis with fibroblast cultures. Normal controls and CF-
heterozygotes could not be discriminated on an individual basis, but
as a group the CF-heterozygotes displayed higher AIP-values.

Texto: Total body opacification is the phenomenon whereby introduction of
iodinated contrast material into the blood stream renders structures
differentially radiopaque according to their blood supply.  The term
implies the physiology: it is the whole body which is opacified, in
proportion to the iodine in its plasma and extravascular
extracellular fluid at the time of the radiograph.  To the density
inherent in the tissue before injection is added the opacity of the
iodine circulating through and transuding into it.  Just as tissues,
even those of "water density," have minor intrinsic differences in
x-ray absorption, so they may also have minor differences in blood
flow and transudation into the extracellular fluid; the combination
of these minor differences often makes the invisible visible.

level was determined, and increased concentrations were found in 12

Cl levels were also found.  The authors give data of their clinical

investigation had clinical characteristics of asthma, allergy and a
functional exocrine disorder.  The exocrinopathy may be an important
factor in the pathophysiology of certain types of asthma.

Texto: Zinc status and the retinol transport system were examined in 18
retinol supplemented cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and 40 age-matched
controls. Plasma vitamin A was significantly lower in the CF group as
compared to the controls and correlated positively with plasma
retinol-binding protein (RBP) in both the CF and control groups.
Plasma zinc of the CF group was not significantly lower than controls
whereas hair zinc was. Plasma zinc was positively correlated with
plasma RBP, vitamin A, and albumin in the CF group but not in the
controls. Plasma concentrations of vitamin A, RBP, albumin, and zinc
decreased with age in the CF group but not in the controls. The data
support previous suggestions that low plasma vitamin A levels in CF
are due to defects in the retinol transport system. The zinc status
of the CF groups as a whole was judged to be low-normal however a
subgroup of CF patients were in the marginal to deficient category.
This subgroup also had lower levels of plasma vitamin A and RBP. The
data suggest that zinc may be a contributing factor in the low plasma
vitamin A/RBP levels of CF patients with marginal or deficient zinc
status.

Texto: A modified method of analysis of sweat chloride concentration with an
ion-selective electrode is presented. The original method of sweat
chloride analysis proposed by the Orion Research Corporation
(Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139) is inadequate because it produces
erratic and misleading results. The modified method was compared with
the reference quantitative method of Gibson and Cooke. In the
modified method, individual electrode pads are cut and placed in the
electrodes rather than using the pads supplied by the company;
pilocarpine nitrate (2,000 mg/l) is used in place of pilocarpine HCl
(640 mg/l); sodium bicarbonate as the weak electrolyte is used
instead of K2SO4. A 10-minute period for sweat accumulation is
employed rather than a zero-time collection as in the original Orion
method. The modification has been studied for reproducibility in
individuals, reproducibility between right and left arm in
individuals; it has been compared extensively with the quantitative
method of Gibson and Cooke, both in normal individuals and in
patients with cystic fibrosis. There is excellent agreement between
the modified method and the quantitative reference method. There
appears to be a slight bias toward higher concentrations of chloride
from the right arm compared with the left arm, but this difference is
not medically significant.

Texto: The meconium plug syndrome (MPS) is a common cause of low intestinal
obstruction in newborn infants. Usually, it is benign and not
associated with other intestinal dysfunction. We describe the cases
of three infants in whom there was intestinal obstruction consistent
with the MPS and in which cystic fibrosis (CF) was later documented.
We suggest that there is an association between the MPS and CF, and
that the condition of all infants with the MPS be evaluated for the

Texto: We have observed severe meconium plug syndrome (MPS) in a newborn
infant who was found during the neonatal period to have extensive
exocrine pancreatic deficiency.  Cystic fibrosis was excluded by
several sweat chloride tests.  Our observation of MPS in a patient
with exocrine pancreatic deficiency suggests that the MPS observed in
the CF patients reported by Rosenstein is probably caused by
pancreatic deficiency.  The frequent occurrence of meconium ileus
(MI) in CF and the rarity of MPS in CF is curious, since they may be
different manifestations of the same pathologic process.
Conceivably, MPS may occur with total absence of pancreatic enzymes
(as in our patient and in a few patients with CF).  Low levels of
enzymes in CF may limit expression to meconium ileus.  We wish to
suggest the evaluation of exocrine pancreatic function in these
patients even if CF has been excluded by sweat tests. - There is
conflicting, albeit fragmentary, data suggesting that exocrine
pancreatic deficiency may not be the sole cause of meconium
obstruction in CF.  Several investigators have suggested that MI may
be the result of abnormal protein and mucoprotein secretions by the
intestinal goblet cells and not from lack of pancreatic enzymes
alone.  While these observations suggest that exocrine pancreatic
deficiency may not play a major role in all instance of meconium
obstruction, it is important to note that there may be little
correlation between the histologic appearance of the pancreas and
exocrine function.

Texto: The combination of ticarcillin plus tobramycin (TT) or carbenicillin
plus gentamicin (CG) was used to treat 82 patients with severe
systemic gram-negative infection in a prospective, randomized study.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the primary pathogen in 7 (93 per cent) of
these patients. Patients treated with TT responded more frequently
(92 per cent or 37 of 40) than patients treated with CG (71 per cent
or 30 of 42) (p is less than 0.05). This difference was primarily due
to a greater response to TT in patients with pulmonary infections (93
per cent versus 68 per cent) and infections due to Pseudomonas (92
per cent versus 70 per cent). Severity of underlying disease was also
an important determinant of response. Except for a greater incidence
of hepatotoxicity with CG (23 per cent versus 3 per cent; p is less
than 0.02), there was no difference in toxicity, colonization with
drug-resistant microorganisms or superinfection between the two
treatment groups. The combination of TT appears to be superior to CG
for the treatment of pulmonary infections due to Pseudomonas
aeruginosa.

Texto: Nine patients with cystic fibrosis but without digital clubbing
(Group A) were matched, prospectively, by sex and approximate age to
9 cystic fibrosis patients with digital clubbing (Group B) and to 9
normal persons (control subjects). Patients in Group B had
significantly (P less than 0.05) lower clinical scores and forced
vital capacity than did those in Group A, indicating more severe
pulmonary disease in the former; however, other spirometer tests of
pulmonary function revealed no differences between Groups A and B.
The degree of digital clubbing had significant (P less than 0.05)
linear relationships to forced vital capacity (r = -0.73) and
clinical scores (r = 0.853) for Groups A and B. Plasma concentrations
of prostaglandins F2alpha and E were significantly increased (P less
than 0.05) in both Group A (X +/- SE, 0.48 +/- 0.03 and 0.87 +/- 0.10
ng per ml, respectively) and Group B (X +/- SE, 0.68 +/- 0.04 and
1.81 +/- 0.16 ng per ml, respectively) compared to the control group
(X +/- SE, 0.14 +/- 0.01 and 0.39 +/- 0.02 ng per ml, respectively).
Group B had significantly larger concentrations than did Group A;
however, plasma concentrations of prostaglandin 15-keto-13, 14-
dihydro metabolite were not different in Groups A and B, and were
significantly smaller than in the control group. These studies
suggest that the degree of digital clubbing in cystic fibrosis is
related to the severity of the pulmonary involvement and that the
prostaglandin system may play an important role in this disease.

Texto: Massive hemoptysis (volume of expectorated blood > 300 ml in 24
hours) occurred in 38 (5 per cent) of 728 patients with cystic
fibrosis.  Twenty-two of the patients were in the midst of a
relatively long-lasting flare-up of pulmonary infection.  There was
no other consistent precipitating event.  All but 7 of the patients
were admitted after the initial episode and were treated with
parenteral antimicrobial drugs.  Postural drainage was resumed as
rapidly as possible after cessation of acute bleeding.  Vitamin K
was administered to all patients.  Volumes of expectorated blood
were as large as 2,500 ml with the initial episode.  Blood pressure
changes occurred in 4 patients.  Five patients received blood
transfusions.  Bleeding stopped without surgical intervention in all
patients, usually within 4 days.  The 38 patients had a total of 85
episodes of bleeding.  No surgical treatment was undertaken at this
center.  One patient underwent a lobectomoy at another hospital but
continued to bleed postoperatively.  Ten patients died (mean
survival after hemoptysis, 2.5 years; range, 3 months to 6 years).
This survival rate is comparable to that of another group of
patients with equally severe lung disease who had never bled
profusely.  The other 28 patients remain alive from 7 months to 20
years after their initial episode.  Our dat suggest that massive
hemoptysis complicating cystic fibrosis may not be as ominous an
event as has been believed in the past.  Because of the tendency of
most patients to stop bleeding without aggressive surgical
intervention, future studies of new therapeutic measures for massive
hemoptysis must have appropriate untreated control patients who
receive only medical management.

Texto: Mucus and serum are always present in sputum. The concentrations of
their markers were measured in mucoid and purulent sputum from
patients with chronic bronchitis, asthma, cystic fibrosis, or
bronchiectasis. Differences in the concentrations of both mucous and
serum glycoproteins were greater among different macroscopic types of
sputum than among diseases for the same macroscopic type. Comparison
between diseases showed that sputum from patients with asthma had the
widest variation in concentrations of markers of mucous glycoprotein
and dry macromolecular weight. When the astham group was further
analyzed, it became apparent that patients with extrinsic asthma
without chronic bronchitis represented a homogeneous group, whereas
those with intrinsic asthma, with or without chronic bronchitis, were
responsible for the wide variation. The concentrations of markers of
mucous and serum glycoproteins in a sputum sample were correlated
with the apparent viscosity of the sputum to establish the relative
contribution of the glycoproteins to the viscosity of sputum. In
mucoid sputum, the mucous glycoprotein was most important in
determining the viscosity, whereas when in infected sputum, both
mucous and serum components contributed to the viscosity.

Bronchoscopy (with or without local lavage) performed in addition to
intensified medical therapy did not appear to improve the outcome.
Future studies of therapeutic measures (including bronchoscopy) for

Texto: To test whether the month of birth of patients with cystic fibrosis
(CF) is seasonally distributed as reported in a Dutch survey,
published Australian data were examined and no difference in the
monthly variation was found between births of CF patients and their
unaffected sibs. When the two groups were combined and analysed by
periodic regression using successively higher Fourier terms, a
significant fit to the observed frequencies was obtained with a
bimodal curve. Possession of a single CF gene seems therefore
sufficient for expression of the cyclic variation. In substantial
agreement with the Dutch series, maximum frequencies were found to
occur in March or April and in September. It is suggested that one or
both parents may be subject to variable fertility mediated by a
temperature-dependent mechanism. The relevance of a periodic
fertility pattern in preserving the CF gene in the population by
selective heterozygote advantage is discussed.

Texto: We are in agreement with Schwarz et al. when they state that the
sweat test has some limitations in the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis
(CF) and that the diagnosis is not justified on the basis of an
abnormal sweat test unless there is other supporting evidence of the
disease.  In our experience a much greater problem of sweat test
accuracy occurs in hospitals where the test is carried out on a very
much smaller number of patients and where the laboratory has a much
lesser degree of experience than that of the authors.  We have had a
significant number of patients referred to our regional children's
hospital who have had abnormal sweat electrolyte measurements
elsewhere, but unequivocally normal measurements when repeated by a
laboratory carrying out a large number of tests.  We have not needed
to go to the extent of serial collections of sweat and of giving
spironolactone as have the authors.  If we obtain a test within the
'grey area' on repeated occasions, we carefully seek other evidence
of the disease, particularly evidence of pancreatic disease. - We do
not advocate the general use of spironolactone: the merit of this
drug in our experiments on certain patients was merely to support our
suspicion of temporary hyperaldosteronism, a condition which might
have led to erroneous conclusions in the absence of K or Cl
determinations.

Texto: Evidence is presented to support the concept that much of the
allergy in cystic fibrosis (CF) is IgE mediated.  Total IgE levels
were higher in allergic than in nonallergic CF patients.  Levels
were also higher in those patients who had had the greatest number
of chest infections in the preceding 12 months.  IgE antibody levels
to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, Timothy grass pollen, and
Aspergillus fumigatus were higher in those with positive results
from skin tests to these allergens.  The serum IgG, IgM, and IgA
levels of allergic and nonallergic CF patients did not differ but
the overall mean values for IgG and iGM were higher than those
reported for healthy British children.  The highest levels tended to
be present in patients with the greatest number of recent major
chest infections and the difference was significant for IgG.  16
patients had IgA levels >2 SD below the reported means for
age-matched controls and 11 of these were nonallergic.  IgA levels
were also higher in patients who had recently experienced major
chest infections.  45 of the patients were tissue types for HLA A
and B antigens but no significant clinical associations with single
antigens were observed.  The antigen phenotype A1 + B8 was more
common in patients with multiple allergic symptoms than in those
with a single allergy or merely a positive result from a skin test.
Nonsignificant increases of W19 in patients with frequent infections
and of A2 in patients presenting with meconium ileus were also
noted.  The data presented do not permit a choice to be made between
the alternative concepts of allergy as a primary abnormality in CF,
and allergy arising secondary to infection.

controlled trial on 43 patients with cystic fibrosis. 28 patients
received the diet for 12 months. Comparison was made between their
growth before, during, and after dietary treatment. Growth changes
were also assessed in 15 other patients who received a conventional
diet. Artificial dietary treatment led to some improvement in height,
weight, subscapular skinfold thickness, and a disproportionate
advance of bone age for the group as a whole. Only 10 (36%) patients
had a 'clinically' significant improvement in height, weight, or both-
-i.e. more than 0.5 standard deviation score. Greatest improvements
were in young and mildly affected patients. It is proposed that the
future use of such an unpleasant and expensive diet should be
restricted to a few selected cases, rather than given as routine
treatment.

had normal lung mechanics in infancy but the 2 restudied later had
abnormal radioisotopic lung function. The symptomatic children showed
abnormalities in infancy and more marked changes later. It is

initially and that damage occurs later even in the absence of

Texto: P-Amino-benzoic acid (PABA) is split specifically by pancreatic
chymotrypsin from the synthetic tripeptide N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-PABA.
The urinary excretion of absorbed PABA serves as an index for
exocrine pancreatic function. The peptide (0.015 g/kg) was
administered orally to 20 controls (aged between 5 months and 16
years), 6 patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency caused by
cystic fibrosis (CF), and 9 newborn infants. In the controls the mean
6-hour PABA recovery was 58.5% (+/- 11.2 SD). Recovery in patients
with CF was lower (P less than 0.001) with no overlap. In newborn
infants the mean 6-hour PABA recovery was 23.4 (+/- 17.7 SD);
overlapping in 3 instances with the results in CF patients. This
simple, noninvasive test thus appears promising and merits further
investigation in younger infants, especially newborns.

Texto: On a 'normal' diet increased faecal bile acid excretion was found in
14 of 16 children with cystic fibrosis who had steatorrhoea, but
excretion was normal in 2 such children without steatorrhoea. The 16
children with steatorrhoea took 3 regimens of diet and therapy: a
'normal' diet with pancreatic enzyme supplements, a diet of reduced
long-chain triglycerides with added medium-chain triglycerides, and
the same diet with added pancreatic enzyme supplements. On each of
these three regimens steatorrhoea and faecal bile acid loss were
significantly less than on no treatment, with the lowest excretions
occurring on the diet of reduced long-chain triglycerides with added
medium-chain triglycerides and pancreatic enzyme supplements.
Although a reduction in steatorrhoea was nearly always accompanied by
a decrease in bile acid excretion, the initial bile acid loss was
very variable and could not be predicted for any given degree of
steatorrhoea. This suggests that at least one other factor, possibly
liver disease or bile acid pool size, influences bile acid loss in
the faeces.

Texto: Bray et al. conclude that the mass screening of newborn babies with
chloride ion-selective electrodes is a feasible method for the
diagnosis of cystic fibrosis; they also suggest that this procedure
might be used in conjunction with meconium analysis to reduce the
incidence of false positive results.  In 1972 we reported the details
of a child with proved cystic fibrosis in whom raised sweat sodium
but normal sweat chloride levels were obtained during treatment with
cloxacillin.  Attention was drawn to the implication of the finding
with regard to screening procedures, and the suggestion was made
that, in at least some children with cystic fibrosis, the cloxacillin
radical might replace the chloride ion in the sweat.  When mass
screening for cystic fibrosis is to be undertaken using methods based
on the estimation of sweat chloride levels, it is therefore prudent
to inquire whether the infant is receiving medication from any source
and, if so, to interpret the results with caution. - These are
instances of false-negative sweat chloride readings, but there is no
evidence yet from our 1205 tests of any negative cystic fibrosis
sweat chloride; the statistical chance of this is in any case small.
These several cases suggest a need for a systematic investigation of
the effect of medication on sweat ion levels in general as well as in
cystic fibrosis cases.

Sensitivity to grass pollens and house dust mite was no more common

Hypersensitivity to Aspergillus fumigatus was found in 35% of

CF; its association with severe lung disease rendered interpretation
difficult. The parents had a normal response to exercise. Both
hypersensitivity to A. fumigatus and exercise-induced airways
lability had the features of acquired characteristics. There was
nothing in the present study to support the hypothesis that the
possession of a CF gene predisposed to atopy.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis, an autosomal recessive disorder, remains the most
common lethal genetic disease of Caucasian people.  The diagnosis of
CF is usually made based upon the clinical presentation of chronic
respiratory and/or gastrointestinal symptoms, a positive sweat
electrolyte test and, often, a family history of the disorder.  The
manifestations of chronic cough, recurrent pneumonias, bronchiectasis
with clubbing, pneumothorax, hemoptysis, and malabsorption secondary
to pancreatic insufficiency are so well associated with cystic
fibrosis that the diagnosis is usually not delayed.  However, it is
often not appreciated by physicians that CF may be associated with a
broad spectrum of less common manifestations as well as extreme
variability in severity of illness.  Lack of familiarity with these
manifestations may delay diagnosis until adolescence or adulthood.
First, there seems to be mild clinical expression of the disorder in
some patients (genetic variability).  Second, the subtle
manifestations of CF are not widely appreciated by physicians in

p less than 0.002, p less than 0.001, respectively), while the
activity of beta-D-fucosidase was significantly increased (p less
than 0.001) in meconium from the infants with CF. It is suggested
that the decreased activity of alpha-D-mannosidase and beta-
glucuronidase might contribute to the accumulation of the abnormal
substances in CF meconium. The highly increased activity of beta-D-
fucosidase raises the possibility of an additional or alternative
method for screening newborns for CF using meconium as the test
material.

ciliary movement of cells of isolated tracheae, and the observation
that ciliary movement is associated with pinocytotic activity led
Ohno et al. to suggest that this defect is responsible for aplasia or

hypoplasia or aplasia of the vas in males with cystic fibrosis is
extremely common, producing sterility in affected males.

infant, the first stool being passed within 24 hours of birth by more

the sources of meconium, and its composition in health and disease

individual constituents of meconium in health are considered: water
and inorganic elements, enzymes, plasma proteins, glycoproteins,
lipids, haemoglobin metabolites, steroids and bile acids, and
sterols.  Meconium from infants with cystic fibrosis has been more
extensively studied than in any other disease and the paper
concentrates on this entity.  The composition of meconium in cystic

adverse effects on zinc homoeostasis were cumulative.  Nevertheless,
zinc deficiency should be considered when somatic and sexual growth

by Dr Margaret Hodson is seriously marred by the failure to emphasise
that the advice on management and drug dosage is directed throughout
to the adult and adolescent, and not to the child.  Firstly,
tetracycline should not be prescribed for young children for obvious
reasons; secondly, the dosage of all antibiotics recommended is high
for infants and small children.  The final paragraph gives a
pessimistic impression of an undoubtedly distressing condition by
stressing the early mortality of the past and of many of the older

perhaps as a result of neonatal screening - together with more
effective treatment may have in the future on the quality of life and

Texto: Diploid skin fibroblasts derived from individuals with the autosomal
recessive disease, cystic fibrosis (CF), were shown previously to be
significantly  more resistant to the cytotoxicity of dexamethasone, a
glucocorticoid hormone, than were normal human fibroblasts. Here
cystic fibrosis fibroblasts are also shown to be more resistant than
normal human fibroblasts to the cytotoxic effects of the sex
hormones, 17 beta-estradiol, dihydrotestosterone and progesterone.
Since cells are believed to contain different receptors for each of
the steroid hormones, it is not probable than the resistance of CF
cells to these hormones results from a receptor deficiency. This was
shown by the fact that CF cells were found to exhibit the same
receptor activity as normal cells for 3-H-dexamethasone. Furthermore,
neither normal human nor CF fibroblasts could be demonstrated to
contain detectable receptor activity for 3H-17 beta-estradiol. In
addition, the studies of fibroblast killing by hormones led to the
further interesting observation that normal human diploid
fibroblasts, regardless of the sex of the tissue donor, are sensitive
to killing by each of the sex hormones. These findings suggest that
the cytotoxic effects of the steroid hormones may be observed
independently of the specific hormone receptors. The studies reported
here thus suggest that the resistance of CF cells to the different
steroid hormones is probably the result of a defect in a pathway in
cellular steroid hormone metabolism other than that involving
receptors.

differed from the women only in that they had a significantly larger
TLC and inspiratory capacity than the women. The resultant
preservation of VC may have an advantage for survival in those

encountered with increasing frequency with age. Massive hemoptysis
did not result in early death. The occurrence of rightsided heart

Texto: This article presents our experience with bronchoscopy as a
therapeutic and diagnostic tool in the management of patients with
cystic fibrosis.  The results from therapeutic bronchoscopy and
bronchial irrigation in cystic fibrosis patients have been quite
impressive.  Levels of blood gas after the procedure have generally
shown improvement.  The vital capacity and FEF1 in general have shown
small but consistent improvements.  The most dramatic effect has been
the patient's own assessment of the operation.  These patients state
that their breathing is less labored in that it is less rapid and
much deeper.  Bronchoscopy offers an effective therapeutic tool in
the management of pulmonary complications of cystic fibrosis.
Unfortunately, the benefit is short-lived and repeated bronchoscopic
procedures are often necessary.  It must be accepted that there is a
point in time when the cardiopulmonary state of a patient's cystic
fibrosis may have progressed beyond salvageable limits.  It is our
conviction that earlier bronchoscopy and thorough bronchial
irrigation may prevent the critical pulmonary event which is followed
inevitably by progressive deterioration of the pulmonary status of
patients with cystic fibrosis.

control and cystic fibrosis patients were studied using alpha-N-
carbobenzoxy-L-glutamyl-L-tyrosine as substrate. Carboxypeptidase A
was inhibited by thiomersal, cyanide, iodoacetate and N-
ethylmaleimide in a similar manner for control and cystic fibrosis
fibroblasts. Both trypsin and dithiothreitol treatment activated the
enzyme, but 1,10-phenanthroline inhibited only in the presence of
dithiothreitol. Both Zn2+ and Co2+ reversed this inhibition. Trypsin
treatment of carboxypeptidase A produced a form of the enzyme having
a higher KM value for both control and cystic fibrosis fibroblasts.
Dithiothreitol treatment of control fibroblasts resulted in a form
with similar properties to the trypsin activated form, but cystic
fibrosis fibroblasts yielded a variant form with even higher KM and
Vmax values. Since other properties were similar, it seems likely
that this difference reflected binding of a molecule to the enzyme
rather than of a defect in the enzyme.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis is the most frequent substantially lethal inherited
disease in the United States. Newborn screening for cystic fibrosis
has been suggested because early diagnosis permits genetic
counselling of parents and improved treatment and prognosis for
cystic fibrosis patients. The fact that cystic fibrosis newborns have
abnormally high meconium albumin seems to offer the best screening
approach. Because we have had equivocal and false positive results
with meconium albumin test strips, we have developed a nephelometric
automated immunoprecipitation method for the quantitative and
specific analysis of meconium albumin. On a total of 3895 meconiums
so far examined, eleven albumin elevations of undetermined origin
have been detected. Nine of these were associated with prematurity.
There have been, so far, no detected true positives and no known
false negatives. The normal range for meconium albumin is in
agreement with previously published ranges determined using manual
immunochemical methods. This method is rapid and economic. The
question of sensitivity, specificity and predictive value of this and
other detection methods is discussed.

pancreatic type amylase were lower in the CF patients (median 26.5
I.U./1) than the controls (median 81.5) (P less than 0.001). The
results for salivary-type enzyme, however, did not support the
previously reported finding of higher than usual levels in CF

analytical methods. It is felt that this procedure will be of value
in the investigation of patients for cystic fibrosis and other

substrates asialofetuin and asialo-ovine submaxillary mucin was
determined in normal, pathological control, and cystic fibrosis liver
homogenates. Cystic fibrosis and pathological livers have about 40%
of the average normal specific activity for sialytransferase. Several
properties of cystic fibrosis sialytransferase were investigated and
compared to those of the normal liver enzyme (Alhadeff et al. 1977).
The pH optima curves were similar, but cystic fibrosis
sialyltransferase appears to be more thermolabile than the normal
liver enzyme. Isoelectric focusing studies revealed that the three
most basic forms of sialyltransferase which are found in normal
livers are deficient or absent in most cystic fibrosis liver. The
data suggest that altered glycoprotein-sialyltransferases may be
present in cystic fibrosis livers, probably a secondary effect due to
general liver pathology.

Random drift is the most probable explanation for the concentration

on abnormal glycoproteins and abnormal glycoprotein metabolism in
cystic fibrosis.  Its purpose is to focus attention on an area
considered by the author to be of great importance for elucidating
the primary biochemical defect in CF.  The majority of the studies on
glycoproteins in CF have been done on crude mixtures of glycoproteins
from tissues or tissue fluids, secretions or excretions.  Very few
studies have compared the properties and composition of purified
glycoproteins from CF patients and controls.  Comparative studies on
the enzymes involved in the degradation and biosynthesis of the
carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins in CF patients and normal
controls are discussed.  Several studies have suggested abnormalities
in CF alpha-L-fucosidase and CF L-fucose metabolism.  There are
several studies which indirectly suggest that abnormalities in
glycoproteins or their metabolism may be involved in the pathogenesis
of cystic fibrosis.  Fruitful areas for future investigation are
comparison of the properties and composition of specific
glycoproteins purified to homogeneity from CF and control tissues,
particularly with regard to carbohydrate composition; comparison of
the activities and properties of the enzymes involved in both the
degradation and biosynthesis of glycoproteins in CF and control
tissues; and studies of the effects of increased electrolyte

Texto: The large number and wide variety of precipitins detected in the
sputum of cystic fibrosis patients suggest that the precipitins may
be nonprotective and even harmful to the patients.  These sputum
precipitins were directed principally against food, fungi, bacteria,
and human body tissue.  On the other hand, precipitins to
Staphylococcus alpha-hemolysin was the main type of immunoprecipitin
detected in CF serum and was found in 60% of the serum specimens
examined.  It seems likely that the precipitins in patients with CF
may be involved in the formation of immune complexes which, in
conjunction with complement, may be responsible for the respiratory
and gastrointestinal lesions that are common in patients with CF.
The immune complexes may be the result of excess food and bacterial
antigens escaping across the gut and lungs as a result of some
abnormality of the SIgA system.  Over 80% of the sputum specimens
tested gave positive precipitins in agar gel against human seminal
fluid and colostrum, suggesting that some of the antibodies formed in
CF patients could be directed against host tissue, and may account
for an autoimmune-type reaction in CF.  Crossreaction between the
high-titer antibody to Staphylococcus and basement membrane of lungs
and pancreas, with complement activation, may occur in CF and
required further study.  The high number of B-cells, as detected by
antibody, coated complement, activated sheep erythrocytes, and EAC
rosettes, may be partly responsible for the synthesis of the variety
of antibodies detected in CF patients.

chloroform-ellagic acid activated plasma in which the proteases can
hydrolyze esters of arginine and unactivated plasma in which the
proteases have negligible activity towards these esters. The
deficiency can also be demonstrated by separation of the proteases by
isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels or by chromatography on
agarose columsn. Since protease deficiency can be demonstrated with
unactivated plasma, the deficiency in cystic fibrosis is probably due
to a reduced number of protease molecules rather than their decreased
catalytic efficiency.

following pathogenic mechanisms: a) Aggregation of proteins giving
rise to a high viscosity of secretions, such as saliva. b) Binding to
the cell-membrane of the glandular epithelium, thus inducing a
disturbance of active NaCl-reabsorption (e.g. by reduction of luminal
passive Na+-influx).

with cystic fibrosis aged 1 to 21 years (M:F = 16:14) and were
compared with results in 40 healthy, age-matched subjects. The
influences of the clinical score, sputum microbiology, and the
patients' sex were also investigated. In contrast to most previous
communications, this paper shows that, compared to the control group,
a significant decrease of C3 (P less than 0.001) and C4 (P less than

increases in complement. Shwachman-scores above or below 70 did not
influence the complement levels, nor did exacerbations of the disease
change the levels. No influence of the patients' sex could be shown.
Pseudomonas aer. in the sputum was clearly associated with complement
defects (14/18). Alternative-pathway involvement of complement
activation could be demonstrated in 32%. The results make complement
activation due to pulmonary infection most likely. The defects
observed probably represent secondary changes.

biochemical anomalies some of which cause serious clinical
manifestations.  They are of great interest to biochemists and
geneticists, as well as to paediatricians and internist for whom
they often present special diagnostic and therapeutic problems.  The
study of the inborn errors of metabolism also has implications in
the fields of epidemiology and social medicine.  The number of known
inborn errors of metabolism has increased rapidly in recent years,
and others, as yet unidentified, presumably await recognition.  Only
a few of these conditions can be treated now, but the realisation
that early diagnosis is essential in order to achieve good results
has stimulated interest in the possibility of examining either whole
populations or selected predisposed groups of individuals for
biochemical differences which characterise particular inherited
metabolic diseases.  This article reviews some recent developments
with particular reference to the indications for such screening
programmes and progress in the identification of previously unknown
inborn errors of metabolism in otherwise homogeneous population
groups.  The inborn errors of metabolism are due to single gene
mutations.  Recognition of the asymptomatic individuals who are
heterozygous for the abnormal gene causing the disease may be
important clinically and the identification has to be considered as
one aspect of metabolic screening for the inborn errors of
metabolism.

cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, including crypt enlargement as well as
intracellular and extracellular accumulation of mucus, have been
considered by some to be useful diagnostic signs of this disease. The
extent of these changes, however, has not been evaluated
quantitatively. In this study, quantitative stereological methods
were applied to biopsies of rectal mucosa from 5 CF patients, 5
sibling controls, and 2 normal adults, to measure goblet cell

was found that CF crypt lumina were variably dilated, but that the
average relative volume of intracellular mucus and the numbers of
goblet cells in CF mucosae were comparable to those of sibling and
adult controls. In CF biopsies, however, surface columnar absorptive
cells consistently contained putative lipid droplets and rapidly
accumulated additional large lipid droplets during short term organ
culture. Lipid droplets were not observed in the same cell types of
control biopsies before or after short term organ culture.

Texto: A method for estimating a 'heparin binding capacity' of human serum
is described. When human serum is diluted with a low ionic strength,
heparin-containing buffer at pH 5.5, protein-heparin electrostatic
complexes form in solution with subsequent formation of insoluble
aggregates which can be collected by centrifugation. Quantitative
determination of the relative amounts by weight of protein and
heparin in the insoluble heparin-protein aggregates permits
estimation of a combining ratio at which serum proteins bind with
heparin to precipitate from solution. This weight combining ratio of
protein and heparin is a quantitative measure of the total affinity
for heparin of all proteins in serum which bind heparin at pH 5.57 to
form an insoluble complex. An unusually high affinity for heparin by
an abnormal serum protein or an increase in amount of a normally-
occuring, high heparin-affinity, serum protein would alter the
average protein: heparin combining ratio and increase the 'heparin-
binding capacity' of human serum. The converse would be true for
serum proteins having a low affinity for heparin, lowering the
'heparin-binding capacity' of human serum. The described method was
used to evaluate the 'heparin-binding capacity' of serum proteins in
normal individuals and in persons with cystic fibrosis.

Indian populations will be required.

Texto: Intermittent epigastric pain, partially relieved by food, was the
reason for examining the upper gastrointestinal tract in a
30-year-old man.  The second portion of the duodenum was strikingly
abnormal.  The patient had a history of daily, multiple loose stools
since birth.  At age 12 a diagnosis of small bowel malabsorption due
to fibrocystic disease of the pancreas was established.  In view of
this history, the duodenal changes were considered to be a
manifestation of fibrocystic disease of the pancreas.  At the present
time the cause of these duodenal abnormalities is unknown.

glycoprotein, isoproterenol, and theophylline in skin-derived
fibroblast cultures from patients with cystic fibrosis permits one to

fibroblast-like and intermediary types of amniotic fluid-derived
cells behave essentially like skin-derived fibroblasts. These
findings imply that if different amniotic fluid cell types can be
reliably separated, prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis should
become feasable in the near future.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis, the most common lethal genetic trait of Caucasians,
causes much of the chronic progressive lung disease in children and
young adults.  It is also responsible for intestinal obstruction at
birth (meconium ileus), pancreatic insufficiency with maldigestion
and failure to grow, and obstructive liver disease in this age group.
Furthermore, obliteration of the vas deferens causes aspermia and
infertility in most males with CF.  Individuals with CF secrete sweat
which contains excessive amounts of chloride and sodium.  Diagnostic
criteria include detection of elevated chloride levels in sweat of
individuals with typical pulmonary, gastrointestinal, or genital
manifestations of the disease.  There are several, well documented
alterations in the mucous secretions of individuals with cystic
fibrosis, any of which alone or in combination, may interfere with
mucous clearance from the lung or from passageways of other organs.
It seems clear that additional studies to define basic aspects of
normal mucous biochemistry, physiology and pharmacology must precede
or parallel studies of CF mucous secretions if data pertinent to CF
pathophysiology are to be generated.  Particular needs include an
understanding of the chemical determinants of physical and
rheological properties of these secretions, and elucidation of
mechanisms for control of sulfated glycoprotein biosynthesis.

fibrosis were isolated and characterized. In both cases, lipids
constituted approximately 30% of the dry material.
Phosphatidlycholine was the most abundant lipid, Significant amounts
of phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol were present.
Hexosyl ceramides, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylinositol,
lysophosphatidylcholine, and lysophosphatidylethanolamine were
present as minor lipid components. Apperciable quantities of neutral
lipids were present, of which triglycerides and cholesterol were the
main constituents. Phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, and
phosphatidylgycerol were highly saturated. Large amounts of
phosphatidylcholine containing mostly palmitic acid, particularly in
the asthmatic sputum, suggest htat this highly saturated. Large
amounts of phosphatidylcholine containing mostly palmitic acid,
particularly in the asthmatic sputum, suggests that this highly
saturated phospholipid is synthesized in the upper airways for
reasons other than its beneficial surface-active properties in the
alveoli.

Texto: To assess the value of detecting albumin in meconium as a screening
procedure for cystic fibrosis [CF] 68,000 meconium samples were
examined by BM Meconium Test, single radial immunodiffusion and
benzidine reaction. The specificity and sensitivity of this
combination of tests were 99.67% and 78.57% respectively. The
prevalence of CF at birth was confirmed as 1:3600 in this country.
This low prevalence resulted in a relatively high number of false
positives. Therefore, a positive test result has a low predictive
value [3.39%] and this is a serious drawback of the method. The
experiences and opinions of 37 local paediatricians about the
screening programme were evaluated by a simple questionnaire. Gold's
decision rule was applied. The least relative cost of
misclassification justifying a mass-screening programme was 3 times
higher than the actual relative cost as suggested by the aggregate
opinion of paediatricians in the region. These results support the
view that with the methods used screening may have more disadvantages
than not screening.

Texto: The purpose of this communication is to review our experiences with
children with cystic fibrosis seen from January 1964 to January 1975
and to analyse the factors which have contributed to the improved
prognosis which has occurred in this period.  The numbers of new
patients have increased from six in 1964 to 12 in 1974.  Both sexes
have been equally affected.  Respiratory infections, failure to
thrive and diarrhoea were the predominant presenting features in that
order, and thus any one of these presenting features should indicate
that cystic fibrosis should at least be considered and excluded.
Each patient was assessed monthly at the clinic during which
attendance formal physiotherapy was carried out and the parents were
instructed in the techniques of percussion and drainage.  Forty-two
of our sixty-four patients are still alive and thirty-three of those
fall into the excellent category, seven into the good and one each
into the fair and poor.  During the period of this review there has
been an obvious improvement with a fall in morbidity and mortality
and with the increasing proportion of patients now in the "excellent"
group.  We attribute these facts to earlier diagnosis, regular and
careful follow-up and a supervised therapeutic programme including
parent education and participation.  It would seem, therefore, that
early diagnosis and active treatment prolong life and give better
health.

of ventilation (V) as a function of tidal ventilation/volume ratio
(V/V0) from the nitrogen washout. The analysis yields a continuous
distribution of V as a function of V/V0 represented as fractional
ventilations of 50 compartments plus dead space. The procedure was
verified by recovering known distributions from data to which noise
had been added. Using an apparatus to control the subject's tidal
volume and FRC, mixed expired N2 data gave the following results: a)
the distributions of young, normal subjects were narrow and unimodal
with a mean ln standard deviation of 0.56 plus or minus 0.13; b)
those of subjects over age 40 were broader (ln SD 0.86 plus or minus
0.19) with more poorly ventilated units; c) patients with pulmonary
disease of all descriptions showed enlarged dead space; d) patients
with cystic fibrosis showed multimodal distributions with the bulk of
the ventilation going to overventilated units; and e) patients with
obstructive lung diseases fell into several classes, three of which
are illustrated. These results suggest that our approach is well
suited for clinical investigation.

Texto: Changes in the nitrogen concentration seen during the single-breath
nitrogen washout reflect changes in relative flow (V) from units with
differing ventilation/volume ratios (V/V0). The multiple-breath
washout provides sufficient data for the V for units with varying
V/V0 to be plotted as a function of the volume expired. Flow from the
dead space may also be determined. In young normals the emptying
patterns are narrow and unimodal throughout the alveolar plateau with
little or no flow from the dead space at the end of the breath. Older
normals show more flow from the dead space, particularly toward the
end of the breath, and some show a high V/V0 mode early in the
breath. Patients with obstructive lung disease have a high flow from
the dead space which is present throughout the breath. A well
ventilated mode at the end of the breath is seen in some obstructed
subjects. Patients with cystic fibrosis showed a poorly ventilated
mode appearing at the end of the breath as well as a very high dead
space.

methods of sputum processing was investigated in 60 specimens
collected from 14 patients with cystic fibrosis during a seven-month

on to media designed for general use in respiratory infections gave
unsatisfactory results (35% yield of Staph. aureus). Some increase in
isolations was obtained with preliminary liquefaction of sputum; but
the best results were given by the addition of a medium selective for
staphylococci (mannitol salt agar, BBL) or by initial sonication of
sputum (each 83% yield). Seven of the 11 strains of Staph. aureus

Texto: Sera from 33 patients with cystic fibrosis and two pediatric patients
being treated for chronic pulmonary infections not related to cystic
fibrosis and six sera or serum pools from uninfected individuals were
tested with a microtiter radioimmunoassay for reactivity against
exotoxin A and two proteases from Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Exotoxin A
was purified from a low-protease strain of P. aeruginosa and shown to
have adenosine diphosphate-ribose transferase activity and mouse
lethality. Proteases were purified from an isolate of P. aeruginosa
from a patient with cystic fibrosis and had proteolytic activity
against elastin and collagen in an assay employing dimethylated
protein substrates. The antibody responses of the patients detected
using 125I-labeled antibody to human immunoglobulin were correlated
with clinical evaluations expressed as a composite score based on
pulmonary findings, case histories, growth and nutrition, and chest X
rays. Values in the radioimmunoassay for patients' sera were compared
with those of a control serum pool and expressed as the ratio of
counts per minute (cpm) in patient serum to the cpm in the control
pool. Inverse correlations were found between these ratios for each
of the pseudomonas exoproducts and clinical scores; highest ratios
occurred in patients showing the lowest clinical scores. These
results confirm that proteases and exotoxin A of P. aeruginosa are
produced in cystic fibrosis pulmonary infections due to P. aeruginosa
and suggest that they may serve as significant virulence factors in
these chronic infectious states.

Texto: It is our hypothesis that in cystic fibrosis there is a genetically
determined specific deficiency in the activity of either the
glandular kallikrein or in its activating enzyme, and that this
defect is the primary defect in the disease.  The immediate
consequence of either of these defects is the absence of kallidin and
the resulting failure of reabsorption.  The fact that there may be
mutations affecting distinct enzymes could account for the genetic
heterogeneity of cystic fibrosis.  A consequence of a defective
kallikrein system would be accumulation of a precursor related to the
low molecular weight kininogen and we propose that this compound is
the ciliary-dyskinesia factor.

Texto: Cell-free culture medium from PHA-stimulated PBL cultures or
long-term lymphoid cell lines from CF homozygotes or obligate
heterozygotes, as well as serum from such individuals, can produce
three distinct changes in the ciliary beat of rabbit tracheal
ciliated epithelium: (1) increased beat frequency, (2) CD, and (3)
ciliostasis.  The ability to produce both 1 and 2 seems to be
characteristic for leukocyte cultures from CF genotypes: 46 of 49 CF
cultures produced both effects, as compared with none of 16 cultures
from normal controls and 1 of 10 from non-CF patient controls with
bronchial asthma.  CTA was not specific for CF PBL cultures, since
13% of normal control and 60% of the non-CF patient control cultures
produced ciliostasis.  Similar findings were obtained when serum from
the same individuals or culture medium from long-term lymphoid cell
lines was tested.  Using protein A from Staphylococcus aureus
covalently coupled to Sepharose CL-4B as a reagent, we separated the
CDAs present in serum and in culture medium from PBL and lymphoid
cultures.  Protein A specifically adsorbs IgG and binds it under mild
conditions at physiological pH.  The CDAs are noncovalently bound to
IgG at physiological pH and can be co-purified with IgG.  The IgG-CDA
complexes can be readily desorbed from protein A-Sepharose CL-4B at
pH 3.0, and under these conditions the CDAs are dissociated from IgG,
retain all their activity, and can be separated by chromatography on
Bio-Gel P-10 or Sephadex G-200.  Three distinct activities were
removed from serum or PBL cultures which showed both CDA and CTA, and
two were obtained from samples which showed only CDA.  One CDA
believed to be specific for CF (CF-CDA) was separated from CF serum
and PBL or lymphoid cell culture medium.  This CF-CDA was complexed
noncovalently to IgG (not subclass IgG3), had a molecular weight of
4000 to 6000, was stable as acid pH, was found in biological fluids
from both homozygotes and heterozygotes for CF, was shown not to be
C3a (anaphylatoxin), did not require IgG for activity, and was
positively charged at pH values more acidic than 8.0.

neonates and infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) and without CF were
measured by scanning microdensitometry after alcian blue staining
according to the protocol of McCarthy and Reid (1963) which
characterises four groups of acidic mucins. In CF infants over 6 mth
of age, but not in controls, there was an increase along the gut from
duodenum to ileum of both weakly acidic and strongly acidic
sulphomucins. In the ileum the increase was in total mucins from 6
mth previously in the same CF patients and this difference could be
accounted for by an increase of sialidase-resistant mucins. The
increase in sulphomucins was more marked at the tip than at the base
of the villi. In CF neonates there was significant difference in the
quantities of acidic mucins. The question whether the mucins of CF
are chemically abnormal or merely accumulated to an abnormal extent
is probably best investigated by analysis of sialidase-resistant
mucins and sulphomucins of the ileum and strongly acidic sulphomucins
of the duodenum and jejunum in CF infants over 6 mth of age.

pediatric patients was performed. A significant difference was found
between 126 normal subjects and 47 untreated children with celiac
disease one hour after load. The one-hour value was found to be more
reliable than was fecal fat analysis in screening children for celiac
disease. Sex, age, weight, and body surface did not influence the
results of the one-hour value in the control subjects. Forty-eight
children with cystic fibrosis had one-hour xylose levels within the
normal range, but the means at 90, 120, and 180 minutes after load
exceeded significantly (P less than 0.01) those of the controls. In a
nonceliac group of 63 children with abnormally low xylose levels,
almost all were found to have clinical conditions compatible with
upper small bowel mucosal impairment. This study shows that a single

of small bowel mucosal function. It is a good screening test for

Texto: The synthetic peptide N-benzoyl-L-tyrosyl-p-aminobenzoic acid is
specifically cleaved by chymotrypsin to Bz-Ty and PABA. The liberated
PABA is absorbed and excreted in the urine. Accordingly, PABA
recovery reflects intraluminal chymotrypsin activity and is an index
of exocrine pancreatic function. This test was evaluated in 24
patients with cystic fibrosis to determine its role in the diagnosis
of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Cumulative percent PABA
recovery in six hours was significantly lower in CF patients compared
with the control group. No overlap was noted between the two groups.
There was good correlation between PABA recovery, fecal chymotrypsin
activity, and coefficient of fat absorption. These findings indicate
that PABA recovery is significantly reduced in patients with CF and
steatorrhea and may prove a practical and reliable test of pancreatic
insufficiency.

was found. In those patients with CF who were over 5 years of age,
one group had high and one group had low lactase activity, as occurs
in healthy Caucasian control subjects of the same age. This finding
supports the view that in patients with CF, lactase deficiency is not
related to the disease entity. In patients with or without CF who had
the same degree of mucosal atrophy, the decrease of disaccharidase
activities followed the same pattern, indicating that enzyme
activities are affected to the same extent by the damage of the
mucosa. In patients with CF with pancreatic insufficiency, the
disaccharidase activities were significantly (P less than 0.001)
higher when compared to those in control subjects of the same age and

Texto: "Hereditary pancreatitis" is important for at least three reasons:
(1) It is probably not an uncommon form of pancreatitis in children
and young adults; (2) the course of the disorder may be chronic, with
substantial long-term morbidity, including an apparently increased
risk for pancreatic cancer; and (3) once having made the correct
diagnosis, occurrence among siblings and/or offspring (and perhaps
other relatives) of the proband may be expected.  Hereditary
pancreatitis is an autosomal dominant trait with apparently complete
penetrance, though markedly variable expressivity.  It would be
reasonable to point out that hereditary pancreatitis should be
entertained whenever an alternative diagnosis is not documented, even
without a positive family history. - We agree with the statement by
Jordan and Ament in a recent article that "acute pancreatitis is one
of the rarer causes of abdominal pain in children and is among the
least reported and characterized."  However, their discussion of this
problem is surprisingly incomplete.  Familial pancreatitis, one of
the most important causes of pancreatitis in childhood, is not even
mentioned; cystic fibrosis is barely acknowledged.  These two
conditions as well as hypolipoproteinemia and ascariasis (also not
mentioned) should be included in the differential diagnosis of
pancreatitis in children and of otherwise unexplained abdominal pain
in this age group. - We appreciate the concern that we did not
diagnose hereditary pancreatitis in any of our patients.  None of the
ten patients with "idiopathic pancreatitis" had a family history of
pancreatitis documented in their charts.  Cystic fibrosis (CF) is not
a common cause of pancreatitis in our center.  We chose to omit
ascariasis from our differential diagnosis because in the developed
countries it is unlikely to be a common cause of pancreatitis.

determine if defective activation of C3 to C9 by bacteria contributes

available C3 was the same as in the sera of the control patients and

Dose-response curves and time course to MCh challenge differed in CF

In all cases, the average responses to Pseudomonas isolated from each

Staphylococcus. Normal plasma or plasma from patients with CF in good
clinical condition does not restore the responses in patients with
advanced clinical disease. However, plasma from patients with low or
no responses to Pseudomonas inhibits the responses of responding
siblings. A progressive specific lymphocyte unresponsiveness to
Pseudomonas may play an important role in the increasing

exclusive propensity for the respiratory tract and may appear at any
age. Treatment with antibiotics, including aminoglycosides, failed to
eradicate P aeruginosa. The continuous use of antibiotics seemed to
contribute to the persistence of P aeruginosa and the appearance of
mucoid strains of P aeruginosa.

Texto: We studied the clinical and laboratory characteristics of seven
patients with sweat chloride concentration consistently between 40
and 60 mEq/liter. Each has chronic Pseudomonas bronchitis, and all
lack digestive symptoms. Laboratory findings indicate the
preservation of exocrine pancreatic function. The patients include
two of five children in one family and two of four in another. In a
third family, one of five siblings has an intermediate sweat chloride
concentration, but another has a typical fibrosis value (105
mEq/liter). One patient died of respiratory failure; results of an
autopsy showed bronchiolectasis typical of cystic fibrosis, but
minimal pancreatic changes. The data suggest a genetic basis for this
variant of cystic fibrosis. These patients may be homozygous for a
portion of a closely linked multigene cystic fibrosis locus or may
have modifier genes that ameliorate the pancreatic and sweat lesions.

Texto: Forty-six patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), 1 month to 32 years of
age, had 51 episodes of assisted ventilation. Thirty-five (69%) died
after 1 to 395 days of mechanical ventilation and six others (12%)
died in the hospital 1 to 42 days after assisted ventilation therapy
was discontinued. Only three patients survived longer than one year
after discharge. These results are much poorer than those reported
for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease of other
causes probably because of the different natural history and response
to therapy in CF. Patients with CF whose conditions progressively
deteriorated despite optimal therapy and no longer respond to
antibiotic and physical therapy are not good candidates for
mechanical ventilation. The occasional patient with good baseline
status in whom acute respiratory failure develops should be
considered for assisted ventilation.

Texto: All of us who care for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are well
aware of the varying degrees of clinical involvement they have.  It
has long been known that whereas the most patients have pulmonary
involvement of one degree or another, approximately 15% to 20% of
patients will not have any pancreatic involvement.  In the 80% to 85%
of patients with pancreatic involvement, the degree of involvement
can vary greatly.  If we can accept the concept of clinical
heterogeneity for the pulmonary and gastrointestinal systems, there
is no reason why we should doubt the existence of clinical
variability for the other major organ system affected by this
disease, the sweat glands.

Texto: IgE antibody production to exoenzymes and common antigen (OEP) of P.
aeruginosa was studied in mice that were injected with the antigens
incorporated into water-in-oil-in-water (w/o/w) emulsion or Al(OH)3
gel. OEP and protease toxoid (PT) elicited IgE antibody response but
elastase toxoid (ET) did not. Capacity of the OEP to produce IgE
antibody was reduced remarkably by it's protease treatment, which
suggested that the capacity lies in the protein portion of OEP. The
w/o/w emulsion was less effective than Al(OH)3 gel in adjuvanticity
to elicit IgE antibody response, but the emulsion enhanced the IgM
and/or IgG antibody response to PT and maintained a constant level
for a long period. These findings may suggest that IgE antibody
response to some components of P. aeruginosa could be induced in man.
High serum level of IgE was observed in some cases of cystic fibrosis
caused by P. aeruginosa infection, although the IgE antibody activity
has not yet been determined.

Texto: Like Dr Chase and Dr Dupont we have found essential fatty-acid
deficiency, usually subclinical, in cystic fibrosis patients.
However, we feel that their data on prostaglandin synthesis may have
other interpretations.  In patients with deficiency of linoleic
acid, oleic acid is used an alternative substrate; and instead of
dihomogammalinoleic acid, an alternative 20:3 fatty acid is produced.
We have found increased amounts of this substance in the plasma of
patients with cystic fibrosis.  We agree with the authors' conclusion
that levels of linoleic acid are specifically related to P.G.
production in children with cystic fibrosis.  It remains to be shown
whether children with cystic fibrosis have a primary abnormality of
fatty-acid metabolism or whether the observed disturbances of
prostaglandin metabolism are secondary to malabsorption of dietary
essential fatty acids.  In either case, certain clinical features of
the disease may well be explained by prostaglandin disturbances.

Texto: A diagnosis of cystic fibrosis was incorrectly made after false-
positive sweat tests in 14 children. 13 of these children had been
tested at hospitals where it seems likely that sweat tests were not
done very often. All the children had normal sweat-electrolyte values
when the test was repeated at a regional paediatric centre where
approximately 250 sweat tests are done each year. In 5 cases,
detailed testing of pancreatic function was normal. None of the
children had typical chest disease and only 2 had gastrointestinal
symptoms. In the absence of the typical clinical features of the
disease a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis should be made with extreme
caution and only after meticulous testing of both sweat electrolytes
and pancreatic function.

Texto: A biochemical link is proposed between secretion and reabsorption in
exocrine glands, in the form of a factor (kinin E) which initiates
ion reabsorption. Activation of this factor involves arginine
esterases, and in cystic fibrosis these may be defective, preventing
the formation of kinin E. In cystic fibrosis stimulation of exocrine
glands produces abnormal reabsorption of ions, leading to the
physiological abnormalities and clinical manifestations of the
disease.

Texto: Burns and May proposed the following pattern for the bacteriology of
cystic fibrosis: (1) Staphylococcus aureus is the initial bacterial
pathogen, and damage caused by it renders the lungs susceptible to
infection by other species.  (2) Control of S. aureus by antibiotics
allows the influx of Haemophilus influenzae.  (3) Pseudomonas
aeruginosa is introduced and continued chemotherapy encourages its
establishment.  (4) P. aeruginosa supplants S. aureus and H.
influenzae, becoming the sole pathogen.  I have examined these ideas
by quantitative culture of sputum from 20 patients seen at the Cystic
Fibrosis Treatment and Research Center, University of Oregon Health
Sciences Center from 1965 to 1977.  The results accord with the
original hypothesis of Burns and May.  In 13 of 20 patients the
sputum bacterial flora changed as the hypothesis of Burns and May
predicted.  This preliminary data suggests that one of the primary
sputum abnormalities in cystic fibrosis may be increased Ca++ which
makes the sputum susceptible to colonisation by S. aureus.  After
infection the Ca++ concentration is reduced and the lung becomes
susceptible to colonisation by other microorganisms including H.
influenzae, P. aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli.

Texto: We confirm that thymidine-requiring (thy-) Staphylococcus aureus
strains are common in patients with cystic fibrosis.  In 7 months, we
isolated Staph. aureus from 11 of 14 patients with C.F.  Despite
long-term co-trimoxazole Staph. aureus tends to persist in the sputum
even though isolates do not require thymidine at first and are
trimethoprim-sensitive in vitro.  Staph. aureus is less commonly
isolated, and of less significance, in most other chest conditions
for which co-trimoxazole is given.  These factors may explain why
thy- staphylococci are recognised more frequently in C.F. than in
other diseases.

Texto: 12 children with cystic fibrosis (C.F.) had lower levels of the
essential fatty acid, linoleic acid, in plasma and in red blood
cells, than did control children, and production of prostaglandin
F2alpha (P.G.F2alpha) was higher than in controls. After 10 months of
oral linoleic-acid supplementation in 6 of the children with C.F.,
the linoleic-acid levels in plasma, red cells, and platelets were
higher and P.G.F2alpha production was lower than in the 6 children
with C.F. who received a placebo lipid. Prostaglandin F2alpha is
associated with bronchoconstriction and its increased production in
children with C.F. might be causally related to their chronic
pulmonary disease.

Texto: Dr Freed and Dr Buckley have shown that a lectin, concanavalin A (Con
A), causes severe rhinitis, sinusitis, and increased mucus secretion
when inhaled by man or small-intestinal colic, foul-smelling flatus,
and mucus-coated stools if ingested.  It is somewhat surprising that
the authors suggest that a suitable inhaled or ingested lectin may be
useful in treating patients with cystic fibrosis, since the very
symptoms produced by the ingested lectin resemble those associated
with the disease.  A more attractive recommendation would be for
patients with cystic fibrosis to avoid substances containing lectins
such as Con A to avoid stimulating additional mucus release.  The
underlying pathogenetic defect in cystic fibrosis may be
inappropriate, excessive stimuli by lectin-like substances.  These
observations suggest that the increase in the protein content of
lymphocytes is stimulated by a plasma factor present in patients with
cystic fibrosis and in carriers of the cystic fibrosis gene.  These
observations, plus those of Freed and Buckley, might suggest that
cystic fibrosis is a disease involving a plasma factor with lectin or
Con A-like activity which stimulates the secretion of mucus and
increases the enzyme content of circulating or cultured lymphocytes.
- Professor Lieberman confuses cause with effect.  If there is
excessive mucus production in cystic fibrosis we suggest that this is
because the secretion is so difficult to remove from the mucosal
surface.  Goblet cells and mucus glands become clogged with
hyperviscid mucus which, not being removed, stimulates further mucus
production.  To deprive the patient of the mucotractive value of his
dietary lectins would be a therapeutic mischief equivalent to
prescribing a cough-suppresant for a productive cough.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis is inherited by single autosomal transmission.  That,
at least, is the general view; but from time to time other
suggestions are offered.  Stern et al. describe what they believe may
be a genetic variant.  The affected patients, they suggest, are
homozygous for a portion of a closely linked multigenic cystic
fibrosis locus, or have modifier genes ameliorating the pancreatic
and sweat lesions.  Do these patients really have CF?  And, if so,
are Stern et al. justified in suggesting that they differ genetically
from the "classic" CF patient?  This hypothesis may not be correct
but, until we understand the basic fundamental defect, it may be
unwise to divide CF into different genetic types on the basis of
clinical variations.

reason for abnormally high sweat-electrolyte levels, apart from
cystic fibrosis, is faulty technique.  A further cause of
false-positive results, and potentially more important than the list
of rare disorders usually cited, is atopic dermatitis.  Dr M. Ampola
and I investigated ten children with eczema at the Tufts New England
Medical Center, Boston, and found higher sodium and/or chloride
levels in sweat obtained from affected skin than in sweat from normal
skin in the same individuals.  In four of these atopic children,
levels within the diagnostic range for cystic fibrosis were obtained
(above 60 mmol/l).

pancreatic insufficiency and not on pancreatic extract had
significantly higher percentages of linoleic acid than did patients

pancreatic insufficiency commonly associated with C.F. disease and
not a direct metabolic defect as some have suggested.

pancreatic achylia all gave abnormal results when tested.  The
disadvantage of the test, as with the meconium albumin test, is that
about 10% of children with CF are said not to have pancreatic
achylia.  Whilst the method needs more extensive evaluation, it
appears technically more satisfactory than others so far described.

Here we report that trypsin-binding IgG (TbIgG) is present in 80% of
CF patients and in 30% of their mothers, but not in 97% of normal

supports the antibody nature of TbIgG, which is presumably produced
against the porcine trypsin ingested by CF patients as pancreatic

serum protein and chemistry screen panel, prothrombin time, and oral
tolerance and absorption--i.e., of glucose, iron, vitamin A, and
xylose. Specialized procedures may be used to nail down the
diagnosis: radiology, biopsy, duodenal intubation, etc. These should
never be employed as routine screening tests, however. In outlining a

find it helpful to consider the particular pathophysiologic
mechanisms of a specific disease. Exact diagnosis makes the therapy

augmented the effectiveness of the aminoglycoside antibiotics.
Ticarcillin is similar to carbenicillin and will play a similar role
in antibiotic therapy. The cephalosporins serve as alternative agents
principally for their antistaphylococcal activity. We are urgently in
need of a potent antibiotic agent against P. aeruginosa that can be
given by the oral route. The TMP-SMX combination is a potent
chemotherapeutic agent that can be administered by the oral route. It
is effective in the treatment of P. carinii pneumonia, which is very

towards the goal of developing an ideal newborn screening test for
CF. It is easily performed, is highly specific, has reasonably high
sensitivity, and--given its limitation of identifying only patients
with CF who have intrauterine pancreatic insufficiency--is the best
method of screening newborns for CF that has been devised to date.
Many technical problems remain to be solved before the test can be
endorsed without reservation. Because the test, as currently
constituted, does not identify all potential subjects for further
testing who might have CF, it should not be made mandatory. It is,
however, better than other available screening methods for CF and can
be praised for that benefit. The concept has indicated a valuable new
direction for mass-screening possibilities and perhaps can, by future
modification, be made sensitive enough to warrant universal usage.

obscure or widen the RPS. We found that obscuration does occur and,
therefore, the RPS is less often measurable in children than in
adults. Widening by the thymus and great vessels, however, does not
occur. The width of the RPS in normal children, 0.5 to 3.0 mm, is
slightly less than in adults. From this study of normal children and
our subsequent experience with pediatric patients, we conclude that
in a child an RPS 4 mm or wider is reliable evidence of disease

report describing a "cystic fibrosis factor" (now designated "cystic

focusing in thin layer polyacrylamide gels.  The recent report by
Scholey et al. confirms that CFP is present in the majority of CF

whether the CFP can be used as a diagnostic marker for cystic

requirements of the method which seemed to have been critical for the
detection of CFP by Scholey et al.  We would like to point out that
Scholey and his coworkers adhered closely to most of our guidelines
during their attempts to detect CFP.  The exact nature of CFP and the
other ciliary dyskinesia factors is only partially known, and all
aspects of their metabolism are not yet understood.  Therefore, it
may be some time before we comprehend the incomplete concordance

saliva by dialyzing it from purified alpha-amylase prepared by a
glycogen-complex method. This method of isolating the CF factor is an
improvement over the previously employed heparin procedure. The
activity of the isolated factor is proportional with concentration
using the oyster gill ciliostatic assay and in its inhibition of
mammalian glycogen debranching enzyme. The ciliostatic action of the
factor can be reversed by heparin under certain conditions. The type
of inhibition of the debranching enzyme by the isolated CF factor
indicates that its chemical structure is similar to that observed
with hydroxyalkylamines and polyamine metabolites. Physical
properties of the isolated factor indicate that it is of low
molecular weight and is labile as a function of pH and temperature.
At neutral pH the conditions under which it is maintained have a
direct effect on the length of time that it is stable.

quantitated using 4-methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzoate (MUGB), an
active site titrant of trypsin-like proteases (7). The reaction of
the proteases with MUGB was complete in 1 hr, inhibited both by
benzamidine and (p-nitrophenyl)-p'-guanidinobenzoate, but not by p-
hydroxymercuribenzoate. The extent of reaction was proportional to
protein concentration and independent of MUGB concentration. This
activity was present in the particulate fraction of the cell. The
mean "titre" values (nanomoles of 4-methylumbelliferone released per
mg protein) of the proteases in fibroblasts from eight controls (N),
8 obligate heterozygotes (H), and 14 patients with cystic fibrosis
(CF) were: N, 1.27 +/- 0.11; H, 0.82 +/- 0.12; CF, 0.66 +/- 0.10. The
differences in the "titre" values for N:CF and N:H were significant
(p less than 0.001) as were those for H:CF (p less than 0.01). The
mean "titre" value obtained for cultivated control amniotic fluid
cells was 1.29 +/- 0.17. These data indicate a reduction in the MUGB-
reactive proteases in skin fibroblasts derived from patients with CF
when compared either to control or to obligate heterozygotes. These
data are consistent with our earlier suggestion (11, 15) that
decreased proteolytic levels in the tissues and fluids of patients
with CF may be a generalized phenomenon.

cultured fibroblasts from controls and patients with cystic fibrosis.
Enzyme activity increased as the transition from exponential growth
to confluence occurred; sodium fluoride-stimulated activity more
markedly displayed this relationship than basal cyclase activity. The
in vitro addition of spermine (1 X 10(-6) to 2 X 10(-3) M) to
membrane preparations caused inhibition of basal and sodium fluoride-
stimulated enzyme activity, with 50% inhibition of basal activity
occurring at 10(-6) M spermine. Spermidine (10(-4) M) caused 15--25%
inhibition of adenylate cyclase activity. The increase in fibroblast
adenylate cyclase activity during the transition from exponential
growth was comparable in cells obtained from cystic fibrosis patients
and control subjects. Basal and sodium-fluoride stimulated adenylate
cyclase activity as well as inhibition of this enzyme activity by
spermidine and spermine were undistinguishable between the different

Texto: The chronically reserpinized rat has been proposed as an animal
model for cystic fibrosis on the basis of morphologic and secretory
alterations in the submaxillary gland and of abnormalities in
pulmonary secretions.  In this investigation, the volume and
composition of pancreatic juice from reserpine treated rats (0.5
mg/kg/day) have been compared to those of untreated controls after
stimulation with purified cholecystokinin (0.1 microgram/kg body
weight) and with crude and purified preparations of secretin (6
microns/100 g body weight) infused iv for 30-min periods.  The
results demonstrate that the treated animals secreted a
significantly lower volume of pancreatic juice after stimulation
with these secretagogues.  Flow rates were also significantly
reduced after stimulation with cholecystokinin and crude secretin.
Protein and amylase outputs in response to cholecystokinin were
smaller than in control animals after unrestritced feedings, but
greater after a 24-hr fast.  Total bicarbonate output was also
reduced after stimulation with either crude or purified secretin and
the normal excretion patterns for bicarbonate and chloride were
either absent of reversed in the secretin-stimulated pancreatic
juice of the treated animals.  Whole pancreas homogenates from the
treated animals showed significant increases in Ca++ and protein
content.  These results indicate that chronic administration of
reserpine alters the secretion of water, protein, and bicarbonate
from the rat pancreas and that it affects several of the exocrine
glands involved in cystic fibrosis.  These findings lend support to
the concept of an animal model for the human disease.  The chronic
administration of reserpine to rats has been shown to induce
alterations in salivary and pulmonary secretions which resemble
those seen in patients with cystic fibrosis.  The concept of an
animal model has been proposed on the basis of these observations.
The pancreas is another exocrine gland prominently involved in
cystic fibrosis and if it can be demonstrated that reserpine
administration also induces alterations in pancreatic secretion, the
concept of the animal model would be strengthened considerably.

and clinical status (with Scwachman scores, P = 0.068).  All the
hypersecretors were in the 14-24 year age group.  Amylase
concentration for this age was significant higher in CF samples
(mean plus or minus SD), 82 plus or minus 37 starch units/ml (n = 
12), than in N samples, 33 plus or minus 17 starch unites/ml (n =
13), as measured by the Student t-test (P < 0.001).  Salivary
protein content of 14- to 24-year-old CF males was elevated compared
to all other groups [1.57 plus or minus 0.76 (n = 5) vs. 0.63 plus
or minus  0.47 (n = 20); Student t-test, P < 0.005].  Mean specific
activity of male saliva dropped sharply as age increased from 10-15
years, from over 200 to less than 75 starch units/mg protein.  Mean
normal female specific activity values were essentially constant [97
plus or minus 50 (n = 18) starch units/mg protein] from 5-30 years
of age.  CF male specific activity values decreased similarly to the
N male values from preadolescence to adolescence, but the mean CF
female values peaked later, at 17 years, with a maximum of 171 plus
or minus 58 (n = 4).  This is significantly higher than all the
other groups in the 16- to 20-year age range: 63 plus or minus 30 (n
= 9), P < 0.005.  These data emphasize the need for age- and
sex-matched controls in all studies of salivary composition.  We
were unable to detect any effect of a salivary CF factor on the
enzymatic activity of alpha-amylase.  Hypersecretion of salivary
alpha-amylase was observed in 36% of CF patients.  This may reflect
alterations in secretory function basic to CF, or be secondary to
the disease process and result from decreased secretion from the
mucous salivary glands or deterioration of pancreatic function.

Texto: Ultrastructural and cytochemical observations indicate that both
cystic fibrosis (CF) sera and calcium ionophore A23187 induce a
swelling or an increase in the size and possibly the number of
secondary lysosomes and an increase in mucus secretion in epithelium
of the rabbit tracheal bioassay system. Extended incubation of the
rabbit tracheal explants with either CF or control sera produces a
cytotoxic effect on the tracheal epithelium, but only after the
termination of the normal bioassay time period. Comparative
ultrastructural study of the effect of both CF sera and calcium
ionophore A23187 on the rabbit tracheal bioassay system indicates
that increased membrane permeability to calcium may be important in
the production of the ciliary dyskinesia response by CF serum
factor(s) in the rabbit tracheal bioassay system.

Texto: Total serum amylase was determined in 83 patients with cystic
fibrosis (CF) (14 of whom had no steatorrhea), 21 control patients,
and 6 patients with Shwachman's syndrome. Patients with CF who had
steatorrhea and therefore lacked pancreatic function had the same
serum levels pre- and postprandially as the control subjects, whereas
patients without steatorrhea and, therefore, with evidence of
pancreatic function, had significantly higher levels. The patients
with Shwachman's syndrome had significantly lower total serum amylase
than the three other patient groups. Only the patients with
Shwachman's syndrome demonstrated a significant postprandial rise in
activity. Only the salivary isoenzyme was detected in patients with
Shwachman's syndrome or CF and apparently absent pancreatic function,
whereas CF patients without steatorrhea had both salivary and
pancreatic isoenzymes. These results demonstrate that patients with
CF have an increase in circulating salivary amylase isoenzyme whereas
patients with Shwachman's syndrome do not. The increase probably
reflects an autonomic hyperstimulation of salivary secretion which is
primary to CF, and unrelated to the state of pancreatic activity.

Texto: Calcium-ATPase activity (Mg2+-dependent Ca2+-ATPase, ATP
phosphohydrolase, EC 3.6.1.3) in erythrocyte membrane preparations
from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients was greatly reduced compared to
erythrocyte membranes from control subjects. The Km for calcium was
found to be similar in the two groups; however, the Vmax, the maximal
rate of activation of the Ca2+-ATPase, is reduced by 50% in the
erythrocyte membrane preparations of the CF patients (P less than
0.001). In contrast, the Mg2+-ATPase activity of erythrocyte
membranes from CF patients was unchanged compared to the control
subjects. No difference in the Na+,K+-ATPase activity in erythrocyte
membranes from CF patients compared to control patients could be
observed. This indicates that the Ca2+-ATPase activity noted in CF
erythrocytes is not part of a generalized membrane or membrane-bound
enzyme alteration. It remains to be determined whether this
alteration in Ca2+-ATPase activity is directly related to a defect in
calcium transport in these cells and is a generalized phenomenon in
CF present in cell types more directly involved in secretion.

Texto: Leukocyte preparations from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients produced
markedly less adenosine 3':5'-monophosphate (cAMP) in response to
isoproterenol than normal cells.  Both stimulation ratio and net
isoproterenol-stimulated accumulation of cAMP were significantly (P
< 0.001) lower in mixed leukocyte preparations from 20 CF patients
(29 trials) compared to 21 normal subjects (49 trials).  There was
no significant correlation of results with clinical score, and no
differences in the CF group attributable to medications or presence
of pancreatic insufficiency.  CF heterozygotes had mean stimulation
ratio and mean net isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP intermediate
betweem normal and CF.  There were no statistically significant
differences among normal subjects, CF patients, and CF heterozygotes
in basal cAMP or prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP.  Purified
mononuclear cells from five normal persons and seven CF homozygotes
had the same basal and prostaglandin E1-stimulated cAMP, but
isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP was markedly depressed (P < 0.01) in
the CF cells.  Granulocytes from six normal persons and nine CF
patients also had the same basal and prostaglandin E1-stimulated
cAMP, but isoproterenol-stimulated cAMP was decreased (P < 0.05) in
the CF samples.  These results clearly demonstrate a difference
between normal and CF leukocytes in cAMP response to beta-adrenergic
stimulation.  The diminised cAMP response to beta-adrenergic
stimulation in CF is probably related to the presence of a CF gene,
and may interact with other genetic abnormalities to produce the
clinical syndrome of CF.

Texto: Infusions of soybean oil emulsion (Intralipid) have been reported to
correct essential fatty acid (EFA) deficiency in patients with cystic
fibrosis of the pancreas.  This article reports the immediate effects
of Intralipid infusion in patients with CF in an attempt to ascertain
through biochemical data whether the use of Intralipid at the
reported dose is free of untoward effects.  Six patients with CF were
placed in a protocol that called for periodic infusions with soybean
oil emulsion containing EFAs.  The first three patients received 2
gm/kg of body weight of Intralipid over a four-hour period.  The
other three patients received half that dose over the same period.
The first three patients developed symptoms of paleness, nausea and
mild discomfort two to three hours after the infusion.  Further
information is needed to determine the best method of correction of
EFA deficiency in children with CF.

Texto: To evaluate the long-term effect of nocturnal mist tent therapy on
the progression of airway obstruction in children with cystic
fibrosis (CF) of varying severity, two matched groups each consisting
of 24 children with CF were studied during 18 months on mist tent
therapy and 18 months of therapy. The progression in airway
obstruction was measured by change in serial measurements of maximal
midexpiratory flow (MMEF), from which a regression equation of MMEF
against time was obtained for each individual. Changes in MMEF value
with or without therapy were compared in patients matched for
severity of disease as indicated by initial MMEF values. For the
group as a whole no differences were found in the progression of the
airway obstruction whether the patients received mist tent therapy or
not. This therapy failed to benefit any of the groups of children
with CF who had early, moderate, or advanced airway obstruction as
judged from their initial MMEF value. It is concluded that nocturnal
mist tent therapy neither decreases airway obstruction nor prevents
its progression in children with CF.

Texto: There is considerable dispute regarding the prevalence of asthma in
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). We studied 50 patients with CF
and compared their responsiveness to inhaled histamine with that of
asthmatic children. The incidence of positive responses to inhaled
histamine was 24% in the patients with CF and more than 90% in the
asthmatic patients. We found no correlation, in the patients with CF,
between the histamine response and several indexes of atopy (clinical
allergic disease and positive allergen skin tests). Positive
responders to histamine were not evenly distributed over the disease
spectrum of CF. Instead, positive responses occurred only in those
patients whose prechallenge pulmonary function was abnormal. We
conclude that the heightened bronchial reactivity in patients with CF
reflects the severity of their underlying lung disease rather than
the presence of coexistent asthma.

change and that patients with chronic hypoxemia may be predisposed to
high-altitude retinopathy at much lower altitudes.

reabsorption mechanism but rather by inhibiting passive sodium entry

Texto: Mg2+-dependent Ca2+-ATPase activity was determined in membrane
preparations of fibroblasts grown from skin biopsies of cystic
fibrosis patients and age-matched controls. This enzyme was
stimulated by increasing free calcium concentrations with an apparent
Kdiss for calcium of approximately 45 micron. Although there was a
great deal of variation in Ca2+-ATPase activity observed between
individual strains, there was a significant decrease in the maximal
activation of the Ca2+-ATPase in membrane preparations of fibroblasts
obtained from cystic fibrosis patients compared to the controls (P
less than 0.05). This observation indicates that decreased Ca2+-
ATPase activity is a generalized phenomenon in cystic fibrosis found
in more than one cell-type. This decrease in Ca2+-ATPase activity may
have a number of implications that may explain some of the
manifestations of the disease.

Texto: Little has been published on cystic fibrosis (CF) in Whites in
southern Africa, and no figures as to incidence exist. A register of
CF patients, their parents (obligatory carriers), siblings, uncles,
aunts and first cousins (potential carriers) has been compiled for
southern Africa. The degree of co-operation shown by colleagues and
by families whose addresses have been provided by them, and possible
reasons for non-co-operation are discussed. From the numbers and
birth dates of patients a rough estimate of the incidence in the
Republic of South Africa, South West Africa and Rhodesia has been
made. In all three regions, but especially in South Africa, incidence
is likely to have been underestimated. Details available from the
register include the number of CF patients alive and dead, those who
presented with meconium ileus, the number of affected patients per
family, consanguinity among the parents or grandparents, the
frequency with which identical surnames were encountered, and the
sibship sizes of all those on the register. Towns and districts with
a population rich in the CF gene are mentioned. The number of
potential carriers has been determined, so that they can be screened
when a practicable detection test is devised. The register has
answered a number of questions about CF in southern Africa. It has
focused attention on the disease in the region and played a major
catalytic role in the formation of the Southern African Cystic
Fibrosis Association.

Texto: Patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were investigated for mucociliary
clearance (with and without stimulation by terbutaline), clinical
picture, ventilatory function and ultrastructure of cilia. The
results were compared with those of patients with congenitally
immotile cilia (immotile-cilia syndrome). Mucociliary clearance could
be demonstrated in all the seven CF patients who succeeded in
inhaling the test aerosol. Ciliary ultrastructure from a deceased CF
patient was normal. Patients with the immotile cilia syndrome had no
substantial clearance and defective cilia. The CF patients coughed
more during the clearance measurements than any other group studied
earlier, and their coughing was effective. One patient succeeded in
avoiding coughing in both measurements and had faster clearance when
he got terbutaline than when he got the vehicle. Although younger,
the CF patients tended to be more obstructed in their lungs and more
handicapped than the patients suffering from the immotile-cilia
syndrome. The latter patients had more discomfort from rhinitis,
sinusitis and otitis than had the CF patients. An impairment of the
mucociliary transport rate is hence unlikely to be a primary
pathogenic factor for the respiratory tract disease in CF patients.

decreased in the serum of patients with cystic fibrosis; major
apoproteins are also decreased. Since essential fatty acids and
certain fat-soluble vitamins depend on lipoproteins for transport in

patients could prove valuable in understanding (i) the basis for the
abnormally low serum levels of these fatty acids and vitamins and
(ii) the effects of therapies involving these molecules.

Texto: Cultured skin fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) are
more resistant to dexamethasone toxicity than are normal cells. We
now report that, when fibroblasts cultured from obligate CF
heterozygotes are exposed to dexamethasone, they have an intermediate
survival compared to normal and homozygous CF cells. When
dexamethasone survival was tested on cells from four patients
undergoing amniocentesis, cells from a woman at risk of producing a
child with CF showed significant dexamethasone resistance, similar to
that of fibroblasts derived from lnown CF homozygotes; the other
amniotic cell specimens showed dexamethasone sensitivity similar to
that of normal skin fibroblasts. These data suggest that the
dexamethasone resistance previously observed in skin fibroblasts may
also be useful in the prenatal diagnosis of CF.

Texto: In previous studies, cystic fibrosis (CF) fibroblasts were
demonstrated to be resistant to the cytotoxic effects of ouabain,
dexamethasone, and the sex hormones, dihydrotestosterone, 17beta-
estradiol, and progesterone. We now show that CF fibroblasts also
exhibit greatly increased resistance to the cytotoxic effects of
exogenous dibutyryl cyclic AMP (cAMP), as well as to isoproterenol
and theophylline, drugs which are known to increase endogenous levels
of cAMP. CF cells were also shown to have normal amounts of (3H)cAMP
binding to protein kinase as well as normal amounts of cAMP-
stimulated protein kinase activity. Phosphodiesterase in CF cells was
also found to be stimulated by cAMP to the same degree as in normal
cells. These findings suggest that there is no detectable protein
kinase deficiency in CF cells. cf cells thus appear to be unlike some
cAMP-resistant mutants described by others which are defective in
protein kinase activity and cAMP regulation of phosphodiesterase
levels. The cross-resistance of CF fibroblasts to ouabain, steroid
hormones, and cAMP may provide a unique opportunity to study the
biochemical events involved in the metabolism of these drugs as well
as the basic biochemical defect in a common human genetic disease.

Texto: The evidence shows that the pathology of cystic fibrosis (CF) is
related to mucoid secretions. Consequently, the question of what
governs the viscosity of mucus is examined in detail. It is generally
agreed that the mucin gel consists of polyanionic glycoproteins and a
hitherto unidentified poly cationic cross-linking protein. It is
proposed that larger amounts of polycations increase viscosity and,
in excess, cause mucus to become a polycation. As these compounds are
known to inhibit the ductal reabsorption of sodium, the two principal
aspects of the pathology of CF can be related to the same mechanism.
The mucus globule membrane (MGM) has been proposed as the cross-
linking protein.

Texto: On 100 sputum specimens selected from patients suffering  from
chronic bronchitis, bronchiectasis, asthma, and cystic fibrosis total
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) content has been related to macroscopic
type, to total dry weight yield, and to the apparent viscosity of the
secretion at 1350 s-1: since DNA may be present, either as fibres or
within cells, in one-third of the specimens the contribution of each
form to the apparent viscosity was assessed. The effect on sputum
viscosity of the addition of DNA in vitro has also been studied.
Whereas between mucoid, mucopurulent, and purulent macroscopic types
a significant difference in total DNA and dry weight yield has been
found, viscosity was not significantly correlated with purulence.
Similarly, the concentration of either cells or fibres correlated
significantly with total DNA but not with viscosity. The in vitro
addition of DNA to sputum caused a significant increase in its
viscosity, and reasons for the differences between the iv vivo and in
vitro effect are discussed. Certain constituents of purulent sputum
tend to increase viscosity and others to reduce it, and the influence
of these varies in the several diseases studied.

chronic pancreatitis, we investigated the sweat chloride
concentration of 95 normal subjects, 43 cases of chronic
pancreatitis, 12 cases of cholelithiasis, 15 cases of peptic ulcers,
16 cases of hepatic diseases and 23 cases of diabetes mellitus with
the sweat test, using the method of pilocarpine iontophoresis. We
obtained the following results. (1) In normal subjects, the sweat
chloride concentration was inclined to rise gradually with age from
childhood to adulthood; the mean value of sweat chloride
concentration was 30.0 mEq/liter in adults from 20 years old, and the
upper limit was about 60 mEq/liter. (2) The mean value of sweat
chloride concentration was 60.0 mEq/liter in chronic calcifying
pancreatitis; this value was markedly higher than that of control
subjects of the same age (p is less than 0.001). (3) The mean value
of sweat chloride concentration in cholelithiasis, peptic ulcer and
hepatic diseases did not differ significantly from control subjects.
The mean value of sweat chloride concentration in diabetes mellitus
was significantly higher than that of control subjects (p is less
than 0.01), but was significantly lower than that in chronic
pancreatitis (p is less than 0.01). (4) It was supposed that some
cases of chronic pancreatitis have a congenital disposition toward
abnormal secretion of sweat glands and epithelium in the pancreatic
duct, resembling cystic fibrosis, and this disposition leads easily
to pancreatic disorders when the individual is exposed to various
external factors.

Texto: The diseases of respiratory system are nowadays one of the important
medical, economical and social problems of modern civilization. A
common symptom of these diseases regardless of their etiology,
character, klinical manifestation and morphological findings is
hypersecretion of bronchial sputum. Tracheobronchial mucus is
produced by mucous bronchial glands and goblet cells. This mucus
represents at physiological condition about 5 micrometer thick cover
on mucous of nasopharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi up to terminal
bronchioles. Protective function of mucus cover resposes in
mechanical and humoral barrier and also in removing the inhaled
particles and their transport to the upper part of the respiratory
system. In spite of the fact, that bronchial secretion has an
important role in protective mechanism and in thermal and water
exchange of respiratory tract, this secretion is not sufficiently
scrutinized mainly of children yet.

sodium concentration. Sweating was induced by iontophoresis of
pilocarpine on the distal forearm. In no case did the concentrations
exceed the normal upper limit for this procedure, and no difference

confirm earlier reports of elevated sodium chloride concentrations in
sweat from 'rusters'. Proposals of a relationship between 'rusters'

Hyperhidrosis of the palms and volar surfaces of the fingers was
present in all 'rusters'. This seemed to be the main cause of the

precipitins against E. coli, 16% contained one precipitin against B.

sera from cystic fibrosis patients, there was a significantly
increased prevalence of precipitins against E. coli (76%), B.

precipitins against each of these bacteria was 3 (range: 1-12), 1.4
(range: 1-4), and 16 (range: 1-60), respectively.  Increased numbers
of precipitins against P. aeruginosa were correlated with chronic
lung infection caused by this species and with poor prognosis,
whereas such associations were not revealed as regards precipitins
against the two other bacterial species.  Increased numbers of
precipitins against E. coli and B. fragilis were significantly
associated with increased numbers of precipitins against P.
aeruginosa.  It is suggested that this association is due to immune
reactions in the intestinal mucosa, resulting in increased
absorption of antigens from the gut.

Texto: Although the mechanism proposed by Dr Katznelson for the increased
intracranial pressure observed in three infants with cystic fibrosis
cannot be discounted, another explanation is possible.  It has been
reported previously that a deficiency of vitamin A may predispose to
development of increased intracranial pressure and bulging
fontanelles in cystic fibrosis.  Finally, it is somewhat difficult to
understand how such marked airway obstruction which produced
increased intracranial pressure could occur with preservation of
arterial blood gases. - Vitamin A and carotene blood levels were not
determined in our cases and therefore obviously this possibility
cannot be excluded, at least in two of the cases.  Dr Taussig's
suggestion that the improvement in the intracranial pressure in our
cases was really the result of the "unknowing" associated
administration of vitamin A and not to the improvements in the
pulmonary status, as I proposed, fails to note the clinical
observation that there had been a "rise and fall" in the bulge of the
fontanel concomitantly with the increase and decrease of respiratory
obstruction signs.  As to the question of the severity of airway
obstruction, the clinical reversible picture of severe tachypnea with
poor air entry, clear lung fields on X-ray with overdistended lungs
and small heart appear most suggestive of airway obstruction in C.F.

Texto: Serum and sputum sol phase from 23 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF)
were examined for occurrence and titres of precipitins against
Haemophilus influenzae and Staphylococcus aureus by means of crossed

four to nine H. influenzae precipitins in serum and in most cases
fewer precipitins in sputum, but, on an average, there was no

Most of the antibodies were cross-reactive with other species,
notably those of the Haemophilus genus. S. aureus precipitins were
generally found in higher numbers in serum than in sputum, but, on an
average, the titre of the precipitins in sputum was higher than in
serum. Three of the precipitins were detectable only in sputum and
not in serum, and one of these is a S. aureus-specific precipitin.
Most of the antibodies were cross-reactive with other species, and
these antibodies were often present in sputum in much higher titres
than in the corresponding sera. Antibodies against teichoic acid of
the S. aureus cell wall could not be demonstrated in sputum, while
they were present in 22 sera. The possible role of the local
pulmonary humoral immune response in protective immunity and in the

patients by the latex fixation test, whereas their sera were negative
in this test, possibly indicating a local production of RF. Positive
reactions for ANA and anti-DNA antibodies were found in 7 and 10 of
the sputa respectively, and in higher titers than in the
corresponding sera, also suggesting a local production. Titers of
autoantibodies in sputum were low and no difference was found between
patients with chronic P. aeruginosa infection and patients without P.
aeruginosa infection. The possible role of autoantibodies in the
patogenesis of pulmonary tissue damage in CF patients is discussed.

Texto: This chapter deals with the problems of chronic obstructive lung
disease in children by first considering an approach to the
evaluation, diagnosis and management of various forms of chronic
obstructive lung disease with emphasis on history, physical and
laboratory data.  A brief overview of therapeutic principles that can
be applied to most forms of chronic obstructive lung disease are
included.  The second part of this chapter consists of reviews of
some of the more common diseases producing chronic airway obstruction
in infancy and childhood.  Patient evaluation topics discussed
include history and physical examination and laboratory studies.
Therapeutic principles in the management of chronic obstructive lung
disease, pediatric precursors of chronic obstructive lung disease,
and chronic obstructive lung disorders (asthma, cystic fibrosis,
bronchopulmonary dysplasia, aspiration pneumonitis, atelectasis,
bronchomalacia and tracheomalacia, immunodeficiency, bronchiectasis,
chronic bronchitis, and chronic upper airway obstruction with
hypoventilation) are examined.

Texto: Meconium is the first gastrointestinal excretion normally expelled by
the neonate.  This review discusses the composition of meconium:
proteins, lipids, steroid and sterols, bile pigments and bile acids,
glycoproteins, mineral composition, and enzymes.  The major
complications relating to meconium are serious: they include
aspiration pneumonia, which may prove fatal and is not related to
cystic fibrosis, the "meconium plug syndrome" and meconium ileus.
Screening for cystic fibrosis is also examined.

Texto: Oral zinc supplementation with 100 mg zinc sulfate over an 8-week
period in 36 patients with cystic fibrosis and 17 siblings did not
affect the vitamin A transport system, as evidenced by an absence of
consistent and significant quantitative changes in plasma levels of
vitamin A, retinol-binding protein, and zinc, nor did the exogenous
zinc appear to stimulate growth or exert any clinical benefit to the
cystic fibrosis patients. The lack of response to zinc
supplementation might be explained by the fact that the group of
cystic fibrosis subjects studied was fairly healthy in regard to
clinical status and certain blood parameters, including zinc.

Texto: Fecal fat, bile acids, and the rectal microflora were studied in
seven control children and in three groups of patients with cystic
fibrosis (CF).  Seven were off antibiotics, ten on oral cloxacillin,
and six on i.v. triple therapy (cloxacillin, gentamycin, and
carbenicillin) for at least 2 weeks.  Controls had lower
concentrations (milligrams per gram dry stool) of both fat (P <
0.005) and vile acids (P < 0.025) than CF children off antibiotics.
Antibiotics had little or no effect on fat but led to a striking
decrease (P < 0.01) of bile acids in the triple therapy group.
Concomitantly, there was reduced deconjugation of bile acids (P <
0.01) and formation of secondary bile acids (P < 0.005).  This was
associated with a 5-fold increase in the percentage of bile acids
found in the aqueous phase of stools and with a marked reduction (P
< 0.001) of the anaerobic flora (log counts per gram wet stool) in
children on triple therapy (4.3 plus or minus 1.9) when compared to
controls (9.8 plus or minus 0.1), CF off antibiotics (9.1 plus or
minus 0.1) and CF on cloxacillin (9.6 plus or minus 0.2).  The close
relationship between the anaerobic flora, the extent of bile acid
microbial transformation, and fecal bile acid concentrations suggest
that reduction of the anaerobic flora decreases adsorption of bile
acids to dietary residues and microbes, favors bile acid absorption,
and leads to a decreased fecal loss of bile acids in CF.

Texto: Measurements of serum bile acids (glycine conjugates of cholic,
chenodeoxycholic, deoxycholic, and lithocholic acids) by
radioimmunoassay in a variety of pediatric hepatobiliary disorders
showed elevations in neonatal hepatitis syndromes, cholestasis, and
hepatitis of extrahepatic or intrahepatic origin. Measurements of
individual serum bile acids failed to differentiate between the
various neonatal hepatitis syndromes. In one patient with
cholestasis, the increased levels of bile acids observed returned to
normal following therapy with cholestyramine and phenobarbital. In
chronic active hepatitis the serum bile acid values correlated well
with the bilirubin and SGOT in response to therapy with
corticosteroids. These data confirm suggestions that serum
cholylglycine and chenodeoxycholylglycine levels are a sensitive
indicator of disturbed hepatic function and can be used in monitoring
the course, activity, and therapeutic response in various hepatitis
syndromes. In Reye's syndrome and protracted diarrhea of infancy,
elevations in serum bile acids were detected without associated
hyperbilirubinemia and provided additional evidence of disturbed
hepatic function.

Texto: The chloride electrode sweat test and gravimetric chloride titration
technic are compared. The two technics gave comparable mean values,
ogives, equivalent points, and overlap for patients with cystic
fibrosis and healthy subjects. As a single test with either technic
has an unacceptable risk for false-positive or false-negative
results, tests should always be done in pairs. A statistical
interpretation technic based on prevalence and technical variability
of the two tests will decrease the number of undiagnosed subjects and
will define probability of cystic fibrosis in the undiagnosed group.

Texto: Potential sources of error in the Gibson and Cooke method of sweat
testing using gauze and filter paper as collection media as
described. The absolute chloride content of gauze was higher than
that of filter paper; however, the variability of chloride contents
between the two was insignificant. Complete chloride elution from
filter paper requires more time than elution from gauze. A method of
determining probability of a clinically acceptable measurement based
on sweat sample size, chloride determination, and variability of
chloride in collection media is also described.

Texto: We describe two infants with previously undiagnosed cystic fibrosis
who had electrolyte depletion, metabolic alkalosis, and dehydration
in the winter and three infants known to have CF in whom similar
manifestations developed.  We confirm previous reports that salt
depletion and metabolic alkalosis do occur throughout the year in the
northern United States and England.  When metabolic alkalosis and
hypoelectrolytemia in infancy are not explained on the basis of other
clinical conditions, CF should be suspected.  Pediatricians should
measure serum electrolyte values promptly and consider early
parenteral fluid and electrolyte therapy as a preventive measure for
infants with CF with persistent vomiting and/or diarrhea.

Texto: Bone mineral content, bone width, and their ratio were measured in
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) using monoenergetic photon
absorptiometry. Serial measurements of the radius and ulna were made
in 27 patients with CF and were compared with 968 age-matched
controls. Demineralization was found in 37% of the boys and 63% of
the girls. Patients under age 10 years had normal bone mineral
content and nine of 15 patients aged 13 or older were demineralized
(P less than .01). Demineralization correlated with the extent of
weight reduction in patients (P less than .001). Patients most likely
to be demineralized were adolescent girls. To our knowledge, this is
the first report of bone mineral status of children with CF, and the
results indicate that a sizable proportion of these patients may be
demineralized without overt rickets.

Texto: This article describes the first time-limited psychosocial support
group for adults with cystic fibrosis (CF).The chronology of the
group is traced, focusing on issues of importance for health
professionals who work with patients with CF. Some of the issues
raised by patient members include doubts about the competence of
nonpediatricians to adequately treat CF; resentment towards "normals"
(those without CF), including health professionals; and the desire to
control as many areas of their lives as possible. Covert (ie,
unrecognized) issues, the role of staff, risks, and outcome are
detailed as a guide for others who may wish to conduct such groups.
The literature on groups for medical patients and a rationale for the
beneficial effects on the group are given.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis is now the most common cause of chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD) and of pancreatic insufficiency in the
first three decades of life in the United States.  In this report we
describe 75 patients with cystic fibrosis aged 18 to 47 years and
review another 232 cases reported in the literature.  All of these
307 patients had elevated sweat chloride and sodium levels, which
proved excellent discriminants for cystic fibrosis even in patients
in the older age group.  COPD, present in 97 per cent, was the major
cause of morbidity and mortality, and differed from COPD of other
etiologies.  The progressive downhill course in these patients was
punctuated by recurrent symptomatic exacerbations of chronic
bacterial bronchitis caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Staphyloccocus aureus, and terminated in pulmonary insufficiency,
cor pulmonale and death.  COPD was complicated by minor hemoptysis
in 60 per cent, massive hemoptysis in 7 per cent and pneumothorax in
16 per cent, problems rare in children.  Sinusitis was present in
all those examined roentgenographically, and 48 per cent had nasal
polyposis.  Pancreatic insufficiency was present in 95 per cent of
the patients, but in contrast to younger patients it was seldom
symptomatic although steatorrhea and azotorrhea were still massive.
Intussusception and meconium ileus equivalent (fecal accumulation)
are frequent in adults (21 per cent) but rare in children, and they
require immediate diagnostic and therapeutic intervention with
enemas of diatrizoate sodium.  Glycosuria, biliary cirrhosis,
cholelithiasis and aspermia were among other complications.  Height
and weight were usually within the lower limits of normal, but 17
per cent of the men were above 180 cm in height and 7 per cent were
overweight.  Therefore, a high index of suspicion is needed to make
the diagnosis, because older patients with cystic fibrosis may look
quite well.

Texto: Turner and associates cited cystic fibrosis as an example of the
application of the judicious use of genetic counseling and prenatal
diagnosis.  The reader who is unfamiliar with genetic disorders,
prenatal diagnosis, and genetic counseling may have taken the "cystic
fibrosis example" as fact rather than a model, as intended.  Cystic
fibrosis is a recessive disorder for which prenatal diagnosis and
heterozygote detection are not yet possible.  Currently, because of
the present inability to detect the heterozygous state, genetic
counseling of individuals with a family history of cystic fibrosis
frequently means a statistical prediction is given, rather than a
precise recurrence risk.

Texto: The development of the exocrine pancreas has been determined
quantitatively in 31 infants with cystic fibrosis (CF) both  with and
without meconium ileus and in 29 control infants. In the normal
pancreas, the ratio of acinar to connective tissue volume is 0.5 at
32 weeks postconceptional age (PCA) and increases linearly to 2.0 at
52 weeks PGA. In cystic fibrosis infants, with or without meconium
ileus, the ration is 0.5 at 35 weeks PCA  anddecreases linearly to
0.3 at 52 weeks PCA. The volume of acinar and duct lumens is greater
in CF than control infants but is independent of age or acinar
volume. The development of the exocrine pancreas in infants with CF
with and without meconium ileus diverges from the normal pattern:
There is consistent lack of exocrine tissue before or a full-term
birth, which persists throghout the age range of this study. CF
infants above 42 weeks PCA can be discriminated from controls on the
basis of the quantitative assessment of acinar volume.

Texto: To investigate the contribution of vagal tone to the obstructive
airway disease in cystic fibrosis, we evaluated the pulmonary
function response to administration of 0.1 mg of atropine sulfate
per kg of body weight, 0.05 mg of isoproterenol hydrochloride per kg
of body weight, or isotonic saline (control solution) administered
by nebulization on 3 different days to each of 10 patients with
cystic fibrosis in a single blind study.  The doses of atropine
sulfate and isoproterenol hydrochloride were based on published
dose-response characteristics of the drugs.  Each day, thoracic gas
volume and airway resistance were measured in a volume displacement
body plethysmograph, and maximal expiratory flow-volume curves were
performed before and at 15, 30, and 60 min after the inhalation.
After inhalation of saline, group mean values for all pulmonary
functions indicated greater airway obstruction at 15, 30, and 60 min
when compared to pretreatment values.  After inhalation of
isoproterenol and atropine, significant improvement (P < 0.05) was
noted in maximal expiratory flows at 60 per cent of total lung
capacity, specific airway conductance, thoracic gas volume, and
residual volume.  Inhalation of atropine also significantly improved
maximal expiratory flow at 25 per cent of vital capacity.
Isoproterenol increased the mean flows by 8 to 46 per cent above
baseline, and decreased thoracic gas volume and residual volume by
11 to 16 per cent with the maximal response at 15 or 30 min.
Atropine increased mean flows by 15 to 77 per cent and decreased
thoracic gas volume and residual volume by 16 to 25 per cent with
the maximal effect at 30 to 60 min.  The mean response to atropine,
expressed as a percentage of baseline, was always greater than or
equal to that for isoproterenol.  We conclude that vagal tone, which
may reflect increased irritant receptor activity, contributes to the
obstructive pulmonary function in cystic fibrosis.  Inhalation of
atropine sulfate will decrease the pulmonary function abnormality,
but side effects prohibit its clinical usefulness.

Texto: This account draws on studies of young and mature lung, on normal and
morbid anatomic features, on normal adaptations as in growth, and
remodeling by disease.  Qualitative analysis of the vascular bed,
development of the pulmonary circulation, right ventricular
hypertrophy or cor pulmonale, remodeling in disease, and experimental
studies are discussed.  Pulmonary hypertension offers us a complex
pattern of structural and functional interaction; we are just
beginning to realize how complex it is.  Information on normal
structure, its modification and remodeling by growth and disease, and
appropriate techniques are available that will enable us to formulate
our questions with due regard for anatomic precision and functional
implication.  And so research will lead to understanding and, it can
be expected, to control of the undesirable aspects of pulmonary
hypertension.

Texto: Forty-six patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) were studied for
colonization and sensitization by Aspergillus organisms. The fungus
was cultured from 21 of 37 (57%) patients who produced sputum. The
non-CF sputum isolation rate was 6.5%. Sputum hyphae were seen in 95%
of patients with positive cultures. Sputum eosinophilia accompanied
colonization by Aspergillus. Aspergillus precipitins were found in
37% of CF patients; positive immediate skin tests were found in 39%.
"Atopy" defined by skin test criteria was found in 46%. All of these
findings were more common in patients with more severe disease (p
less than 0.05). CF patients had predominant mold sensitivity in
contrast to predominant pollen sensitivity in a control group of
asthmatic subjects. Serum IgE concentrations were increased in 22% of
CF patients. CF patients who had increased serum concentrations of
IgE were more likely to have a family history of atopy. Wheezing was
more common in those who were atopic, especially the group with
predominant mold sensitivity who had more severe disease. Four
patients fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for allergic
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) during the time of study and
follow-up. A fifth patient had ABPA diagnosed before the study. The
incidence of ABPA during a 2-yr period in our CF population was 11%.

Texto: Flows measured from maximal expiratory flow-volume (MEFV) curves were
used to evaluate the efficacy of postural drainage in improving
ventilatory function acutely. Maximal expiratory flow-volume curves
were obtained for 9 cystic fibrosis subjects and 10 subjects with
chronic bronchitis before and 5, 15, and 45 min after a 30-min
session of postural drainage with percussion, vibration, and
coughing. Forced vital capacity (FVC) was significantly increased 45
min after drainage for the combining group. Flows at high lung
volumes were different for the 2 subgroups. Subjects with cystic
fibrosis demonstrated a significant increase in peak expiratory flow
rates 45 min after drainage and an increase in forced expiratory
volume in one sec at all time intervals. The subjects with chronic
bronchitis had a decreased peak expiratory flow rate 5 min after
drainage, but by 45 min, it had returned to baseline. There was no
significant change in one-sec forced expiratory volume at any time
interval for the chronic bronchitis subgroup. Changes in flows at low
lung volumes were similar for the 2 subgroups. Forty-five min after
drainage there was an increase in flow rates near 50 per cent of FVC.
Flows near 25 per cent of FVC were increased 15 and 45 min after
drainage. This study demonstrated that postural drainage with
coughing resulted in significant improvement in flows at low lung
volumes. Changes in flows at high lung volumes were less consistent.

were studied to evaluate their usefulness in identifying those with
atopy. Ten of 36 patients with cystic fibrosis (28%) had an abnormal

exercise alone cannot identify patients with atopic disease among
those with cystic fibrosis.

Texto: This review describes the development and application of a novel test
to determine levels of human immunoreactive trypsin, an enzyme
produced solely by the pancreas, in biological fluids. Being organ-
specific, the assay of immunoreactive trypsin should be an ideal
marker of pancreatic function, and this is supported by the results
of a number of clinical and research investigations. Use of this
assay in studies of chronic pancreatitis, juvenile-onset diabetes,
and cystic fibrosis has yielded much valuable data, and it is
expected that further research will lead to an improved understanding
of these and other conditions associated with the pancreas in health

in the treatment of chest complications of cystic fibrosis. A
mechanical device that allows the patient with cystic fibrosis to do
his own chest physiotherapy will be of great benefit if it is as
effective as manual percussion. 14 patients with cystic fibrosis
using mechanical and manual percussion physiotherapy were studied by
measuring sputum volumes, and FEV and FVC. Results with mechanical
percussor were as good as with the manual percussor and, therefore,
it would be reasonable for the older patient to use the former on his

Texto: During a 4-year routine screening programme for cystic fibrosis (CF)
15 464 specimens were examined for raised meconium albumin levels by
a test strip method and by electroimmunoassay. The incidence of false-
positive results was about 5 per 1000 specimens in either test. This
could be reduced by 90% by determining the ratio of albumin : alpha-1-
trypsin inhibitor (a ratio below 2.0 being considered as a negative
result), and it could be reduced to zero by determining the ratio in
subsequent faecal specimens. Three of 12 meconium specimens from
infants with proved CF gave false-negative results in all 3 tests.
The other 9 specimens had greater than 100 mg albumin/g dry weight
and albumin: alpha-1-trypsin inhibitor ratios of greater than 3.0; in
subsequent faecal specimens the ratios were over 4.0. 176 meconium
specimens from elsewhere in the UK were examined and these included
23 from infants who were subsequently proved to have CF. Six of these
23 CF specimens gave false-negative results, the other 17 being
strongly positive. The origins of meconium serum protein suggest that
infants with CF in whom meconium gives false-negative results have
normal pancreatic functions at birth. The specificity of current
meconium tests therefore cannot be improved as they depend on
pancreatic dysfunction.

Texto: The quantitative and qualitative distribution of bile salts in the
duodenal juice of 13 patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) was studied
after a test meal. The effects of triolein (TO), bovine serum albumin
(BSA), and ricinoleic acid (RA) on the absorption of taurocholate
(TCA) in the distal ileum of the rat in vivo was also studied. The
mean (and ranges) of total bile salt concentrations, glycine: taurine
conjugate ratios, and percentage of dihydroxy bile salts in the
patients with CF and pancreatic insufficiency were 3.5 (1.3--6.6)
mmol/l, 8.6 (greater than 10-3.1), and 37 (10--60) compared with
control values of 7.4 (3.0--16.0) mmol/l, 3.0 (1.3--4.5), and 61 (52--
70) respectively. The differences between the control and CF values
were statistically significant (P less than 0.01--P less than 0.001).
Three of the 13 CF patients had total bile salt concentrations less
than 2 mmol/l, 8 had much higher glycine: taurine ratios, and 8 had a
reduced percentage of dihydroxy bile salts. In 2 patients with normal
pancreatic enzyme activities, duodenal bile salts were both
quantitatively and qualitatively normal. TO (10 and 30 mmol/l), BSA
(3%), and RA (5 mmol/l) had no inhibitory effect on the ileal
absorption of TCA. These results show pronounced abnormalities of
duodenal juice bile salts in CF with pancreatic insufficiency
consistent with a broken enterohepatic circulation (EHC); such
abnormalities may contribute to defective lipid absorption in CF. The
data in the experimental animal do not support the suggestion that
unhydrolysed dietary substrates play a role in the pathophysiology of
the broken EHC.

Texto: An episode of severe small intestinal hemorrhage occurred in a cystic
fibrosis patient having pancreatic insufficiency and receiving timed-
release aspirin therapy for disabling hypertrophic pulmonary
osteoarthropathy. The increased acidity of small intestinal contents
due to decreased bicarbonate secretion observed in patients with
pancreatic insufficiency may alter the luminal environment and result
in mucosal erosions and/or ulcerations in association with the
presence of aspirin. Thus, physicians should be aware of the
possibility that timed-release aspirin causes small intestinal
hemorrhage in such patients.

children with CF would be expected to have a higher than usual
incidence of middle ear disease. Eighty patients who were afflicted
with CF had audiological evaluations, which consisted of hearing
threshold levels (250 to 8,000 Hz) and speech and impedance
audiometry. We found no greater incidence of a conductive or

strength of commitment to vocational choice, work values, and
awareness of occupational information. Compared to 4 additional
handicapped groups already studied, adolescents with cystic fibrosis
scored favorably. They not only plan to work but also hold strong
work values compared to normals. Rehabilitation programs should
emphasize preparation for a career and the development of educational
and vocational plans while the adolescent is still in high school.

penicillanic acid sodium salt (azlocillin, Securopen) was given in
doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg body weight to children with cystic
fibrosis. After intravenous bolus infections, the serum half-life was
0.82 +/- 0.12 h after the lower dose and 0.98 +/- 0.18 h after the
higher dose. This was consequent to a dose limited elimination
kinetics due to limitation in both renal and non-renal processes of
elimination. Upon doubling of the dose from 100 to 200 mg/kg, the
total body clearance dropped from 13.93 to 5.10 1/h. Evaluation of
data presented in other publications indicate that a dose limited
elimination kinetics is the normal situation for azlocillin. Besides,
the serum concentrations of patients with cystic fibrosis were
considerably lower than seen in the healthy state. The reason is
faster elimination by the renal route in cystic fibrosis.

fucosidase purified from cystic fibrosis and control livers exhibits
differential binding to the lectin Concanavalin A.  The
concentration of alpha-CH3-mannoside necessary to prevent 50%
binding of alpha-L-fucosidase to Concanavalin A is considerably
lower for the cystic fibrosis enzyme (13.5 vs. 33.3 mM).  Comparable
results were found when binding studies were done on crude
supernatant alpha-L-fucosidase from 8 cystic fibrosis and 8 control
livers (5.6 plus or minus 0.4 mM and 13.2 plus or minus 3.4
respectively), without any overlap of values between the cystic
fibrosis and control livers.  These results suggest that comparative
lectin binding studies on cystic fibrosis and normal glycoproteins
from readily available tissues might result in an assay for
detecting the cystic fibrosis genotype.

Texto: One of the symptoms of cystic fibrosis (mucoviscidosis) is pancreatic
insufficiency.  The reduced proteolytic activity in the gut of
children with the disease results in an elevated concentration of
protein, especially serum albumin, in the meconium.  This feature is
used in the diagnosis of the disease in the newborn, and we decided
to examine the utility of enzyme immunoassay for the measurement of
albumin in meconium samples from normal and cystic fibrosis infants.
Normal samples were found to have apparent albumin concentrations in
the range 0.05-0.26 mg/g dry wt., whereas cystic fibrosis samples had
concentrations in the range 60-230 mg/g dry wt.  The assay provides a
cheap and relatively rapid method of differentiating cystic fibrosis
positive and negative meconium samples.

cultured human fibroblasts by dibutyryl cyclic AMP, sodium butyrate,
the serum glycoprotein fetuin, the Tamm-Horsfall urinary

uninduced basal enzyme activity increased at later stages of growth
when the cells became confluent. Induction by dibutyryl cyclic AMP or

had reached stationary phase and was maximal after at least two days
of exposure. The levels of induction resulting from the addition of
pairs of the agents, dibutyryl cyclic AMP, n-butyrate and fetuin were
additive indicating that these have different modes of action. The
inhibitors of DNA synthesis, cytosine arabinoside, hydroxyurea, and
methothrexate were less effective inducers. Bromodeoxyuridine which
also has non-DNA mediated effects induced to the same extent as
dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Similar experiments with sex- and age-matched
cell strains derived from patients with cystic fibrosis failed to
detect differences in the levels of induction from those observed in
normal cells. In addition, the combined inductive effects of Tamm-
Horsfall glycoprotein, isoproterenol and theophylline, were similar
with normal and cystic fibrosis cells.

Texto: The lipid composition of isolated plasma membranes of human skin
fibroblasts is described for the first time. Plasma membranes from a
number of strains of fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis
and matched normals were isolated by a recently described procedure
and analysed for major phospholipid classes, cholesterol and fatty
acids. No differences in the quantities of these compounds were
detected between cells of the two different origins. The fetal calf
serum used to supplement the growth medium contained relatively more
palmitoleate and oleate but less stearate than the membranes. There
were also no consistent differences between cystic fibrosis and
normal membranes in terms of the fatty acid compositions of their
individual phospholipid classes. Consistent with this lack of
chemical change in the lipids of membranes of cystic fibrosis cells,
the degree of fluorescence polarization of diphenylhexatriene, an
index of fluidity, was also unchanged.

Texto: The central problem of the mid-20th century genetic counselor has
been to determine the place of the genes in the origin of complex
human characteristics - such as neural tube defects, cleft palate,
diabetes, and congenital heart disease - in short, the major
malformation and polygenic syndromes which make up the bulk of what
we call birth defects.  Of comparable importance in terms of genetic
counseling is understanding the origin and incidence of the newly
recognized genetic heterogeneity lying behind what had previously
been regarded as simple, single-gene determined diseases.  Topics
include dealing with genetic heterogeneity, phenotypes and genotypes,
where genetic causation defies simple analysis, and sources of
variation.  Behavior disorders with presumptive single-gene causation
(Lesch-Nyhan disease), presumptive sex-linked causation
(aggressivity), and presumptive polygenic causation (alcoholism) are
also discussed.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis is the commonest semilethal genetic disorder in
Caucasians.  The biochemical sequence that leads to widespread
dysfunction of exocrine glands has yet to be determined.  Cystic
fibrosis in adults has been the subject of extensive review.  We
still do not know the cause of the changes in the lungs.  Pancreatic
insufficiency was recorded in 95% of the patients, but the older ones
needed little dietary restriction and some seemed to thrive without
pancreatic replacement.  Ninety-five per cent of males have aspermia
due to failure of development of the vas deferens, epididymis, and
seminal vesicles.  Despite the obvious handicap and emotional and
social strains in all four series, adolescent and adult patients with
cystic fibrosis not only did well at school and at work but managed
to fit in well in their social framework.

Texto: The force of impact and frequency of percussion by physiotherapists
and parents of children with cystic fibrosis were analysed on a
special test rig and incorporated in a prototype percussor. In adult
volunteers and cadavers a maximum intrathoracic pressure could be
achieved by a critical frequency of mechanical percussion which was
higher than that reached by physiotherapists and parents.
Consequently the percussor was redesigned to operate at this optimum
frequency. It was then discovered that if the percussor was pressed
firmly enough against the chest, this maximum intrathoracic pressure
could be indicated by quivering of the voice. In a continuing study
of intrathoracic pressures obtained mechanically and manually the
Salford percussor's produced higher pressures than the
physiotherapists' and maintained them constantly, while the
physiotherapists' efforts and results varied from one to another.
Hospital and domiciliary use of the percussor have shown it to help
in the first stage of the physiotherapy routine for patients with
cystic fibrosis. The percussor should enable adolescents and adults
to treat themselves and encourage twice-daily and more effective
chest treatments. It is easy to apply and its speed and efficiency
should enable parents to improve the quality of their chest therapy
for younger children at home. Its long-term benefits are difficult to
assess because of the nature of the disease.

showed that an assistant did not further improve the results obtained
by the patient performing the forced expiration technique himself.
These findings mean that patients with cystic fibrosis who have had

perform more effective treatment without help. The forced expiration
technique might also be helpful for patients with chronic bronchitis,
asthma, or bronchiectasis.

Texto: The control of symptoms in dying children is often sadly neglected.
This neglect is reflected in a review of the case notes of two
children who died of cystic fibrosis within three years of each
other.  The girls were under the care of the same consultant, who in
the interval between the two cases was introduced to the concept of
proper terminal care for children.  These two cases show that illness
can cause physical, emotional, and spiritual pain to family and
staff.  In retrospect these areas of distress were not clearly
defined in either case and opportunities to alleviate suffering were
missed.  The principles of controlling symptoms need to be remembered
as much during distressing treatment as during the distress of dying.

Texto: The combination of chronic pulmonary sepsis and pancreatic
insufficiency in children with cystic fibrosis may lead to
malnutrition.  We describe our experience of the long-term use of
continuous nocturnal infusion of elemental diet in a patient with
cystic fibrosis.  Our patient tolerated the long-term nocturnal
elemental diet well, and it enabled her to continue normal
everyday activity and eat normal meals.  The periods of nutritional
support coincided with periods of increased body weight and total
body potassium, indicating that the lean body mass was increased.
We think that these results show a need for further studies of home
treatment in children with cystic fibrosis.

Texto: Static lung volumes (VC, TLC, FRC, RV), elastic recoil pressure of
the lungs (Pst(1) at 100, 90, and 60% of TLC), static lung compliance
[Cst(1)], specific airway conductance at FRC level (Gaw/TGVex),
forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), maximal
expiratory flows (Vmax.) at 25 and 50% of VC and at 60% of TLC, and
"upstream" airway conductance (Gus) at 60% of TLC were studied in 28
patients with cystic fibrosis, 5 to 25 years old, over a period of 1
to 5 years. The data were compared individually with normal values,
related to body height in the form of regression equations and
expressed in percentage of predicted values. From the indices
assessing airway function, Vmax. at low lung volumes, Gus at 60% TLC,
RV and RV/TLC were the functional parameters most consistently
abnormal. Among the indices characterizing lung elasticity, Pst(1) at
60% TLC was the most abnormal. Generally, the values of the majority
of lung function indices [VC, TLC, FRC, Pst(1)] declined during
growth. Vmax. at all lung volumes and Gus at 60% TLC did not
deteriorate with growth probably due to the great abnormality of
these parameters already in young patients. It was also observed that
lung function did not change significantly over a period of 1 to 5
years corresponding to a 10 cm increase in body height. However, over
that period, lung function improved in some of the subjects, did not
change in over 50% of the cases and deteriorated in the others.

Texto: This study investigated the roles of hypoxia, pulmonary mechanics,
nutritional status and serum fatty acid composition in limiting
exercise tolerance in cystic fibrosis.  Twenty children with CF of
carrying severity performed two progressive exercise tests on a cycle
ergometer, once while breathing air, once while breathing O2. The
children with the lower maximal mid-expiratory flow rates tended to
have very little respiratory reserve at the final work load.  We
conclude that nutritional status and airway obstruction are closely
correlated with exercise tolerance in CF and that, unlike the adult
with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, exercise limiting
dyspnoea occurs in the presence of normal end-tidal CO2.

angiocardiography to assessment of right ventricular ejection
fraction and the relationship between right and left heart
performance demonstrated by this technique.  Prior to discussion of
the clinical applications, the functional geometry of the two
ventricles will be reviewed.  In addition, the first-pass radiotracer
techniques will be compared to other radionuclide imaging approaches
of the right heart.  First-pass radionuclide angiocardiographic
techniques are now suitable for clinical application.  They have been
validated and standardized and can be relied upon for accurate,
reproducible noninvasive assessment of right and left ventricular
performance.  They already have been applied to the study of patients
with cardiopulmonary disease; future directions will include earlier
evaluation of myocardial infarction, application to children and
adults with a variety of congenital cardiac abnormalities (primarily
those affecting the right heart), and assessment of the effects of
physiologic stress upon right ventricular function.  With this
background valuable clinical and investigative insights should become
available during the coming years.

Texto: Of 97 well-defined strains of Pseudomonas, isolated from sputum of
patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), the minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) of several antibiotics was determined with a
broth dilution method. The majority of the strains were resistant to
ampicillin and cephalothin, moderately susceptible to carbenicillin
(70% to 100 microgram/ml) and highly susceptible to piperacillin
(100% to 25 microgram/ml, 88% to 6.25 microgram and 60% to 3.12
microgram/ml). If the pharmacological properties of piperacillin are
comparable with those of carbenicillin, it can be expected that the
sputum level of this drug will be adequate to treat Pseudomonas
pulmonary infections. At the lowest concentration tested (0.78
microgram/ml) 3% of the strains were susceptible to kanamycin, 85,5%
to amikacin, 95% to gentamicin, 98% of tobramycin, and 80% to
colimycin. With regard to clinically attainable concentrations, 98.9%

amikacin, 96.9% to colimycin, 88.6%  to piperacillin, 38% to
carbenicillin, 25.7% to kanamycin, 12.3% to ampicillin, and 1% to

Texto: In this echocardiographic study, assessment of the heart in children
with cystic fibrosis has shown that changes occur in not only the
right ventricle but also in the left ventricle and aorta, as compared
with normal. Echocardiograms could be successfully performed in 34 of
37 patients. The thickness of the right ventricular anterior wall and
the dimension of the right ventricular cavity  were abnormal, even in
patients with mild disease (National Institutes of Health [NIH] score
for severity of disease of 85 or greater). Larger, older children
with lower NIH score had disproportionately larger right ventricular
anterior walls and cavities. The thickness of the septal wall, the
thickness of the left ventricular posterior wall, and the aortic
dimensions were increased in those with severe disease. The
dimensions of the left ventricular cavity for the population were
slightly but significantly smaller than normal in systole and in
diastole throughout the course of the disease. This study
demonstrates that echocardiography is an effective noninvasive means
of assessing the long-term changes in children with cystic fibrosis.
These changes occur in both sides of the heart and appear to worsen
as the disease progresses.

Texto: In the present study, we compared the levels of a series of cultured
lymphocytic acid-hydrolase enzymes in cystic fibrosis homozygotes,
heterozygotes and controls; compared the effects of three different
mitogens on these levels; and studied the effect of CF vs control
serum in the culture medium.  Our observations provide an entirely
new interpretation for the apparent changes occurring in lymphocytic
enzymes during culture of lymphocytes with mitogens, and suggest that
a serum factor is present in cystic fibrosis serum that mimics
mitogens in this regard.  Lymphocytic acid-hydrolases and total
protein are present in higher concentrations in lymphocytes cultured
for 48 hours without mitogen when CF homozygous or heterozygous serum
is present in the culture media.  This appears to result from a CF
serum factor that has mitogen-like activity and prevents loss of cell
protein during culture.  Responsiveness of the cellular proteins to
mitogens is blunted when CF serum is present in the culture media,
either because the cell proteins are already maximally stimulated by
the CF serum factor, or the factor blocks or modifies the action of
mitogens on lymphocyte protein content.  This phenomenon is useful
for detection of CF heterozygosity, and appears to reflect the
genetic abnormality causing cystic fibrosis.

Texto: This study demonstrates the clinical feasibility of atraumatically
measuring dynamic regional lung function with tetrapolar electrical
impedance plethysmography (EIP) in the pediatric age group. A
tetrapolar electrode system was used because of its ability to detect
local baseline and pulsatile impedance changes, minimal electrode-
tissue impedance interference, and uniform current distribution.
Studies performed on 4 children 4 to 15 years old with various
pulmonary diseases are presented. The information obtained on their
regional ventilation and pulsatile perfusion by EIP was found to
agree closely with pulmonary ventilation and perfusion scans. In one
case, EIP detected pulsatile perfusion abnormalities which were not
apparent in the non-pulsatile perfusion scan but were demonstrated by
cineangiography. It is concluded that tetrapolar EIP can provide
safe, reliable regional information about ventilation and perfusion
in diseased lungs, and because of its atraumatic approach, is
technically most suitable for use in children.

Texto: To explain why the single-breath carbon monoxide diffusing capacity
(Dsb) was, on the average, elevated in 163 asthmatic subjects and 175
patients with cystic fibrosis, we simulated this elevation in ten
normal subjects by having them perform the test for Dsb through an
inspiratory obstruction. This resulted in an 18 percent increase in
Dsb corrected for pulmonary volume. Inhalation of a bronchodilator
drug was associated with relief of obstruction and a fall in the
corrected Dsb in 31 asthmatic subjects but did not change either the
obstruction or the corrected Dsb in 17 patients with cystic fibrosis.
We suggest that elevated Dsb in asthma and cystic fibrosis is partly
due to maximal inspiration against obstructed airways. This requires
abnormally negative intrathoracic pressures, increasing the pulmonary
capillary blood volume, and, thereby, increasing the Dsb.

Texto: An echographic study was undertaken to evaluate left (LV) and right
ventricular (RV) function in 30 patients with cystic fibrosis.
Echographic recording of the pulmonary and aortic valve echogram
permitted measurement of the phases of right and left ventricular
systole. The ratio of the LV preejection period/LV ejection time
(LPEP/LVET) and shortening of the LV internal dimension %SID was
employed to reflect LV function, while RV preejection period/RV
ejection time (RPEP/RVET) has excellent correlation with pulmonary
artery diastolic pressure. RPEP/RVET and two other echographic
measurements, right ventricular wall (RVW) and internal dimension
(RVD) were compared with pulmonary function tests and clinical
scores. RPEP/RVET correlated well with percent vital capacity(%VC), r
= -0.73, percent residual volume (%RVol) r = +0.72, and clinical
score, r = -0.77. Multilinear regression of RPEP/RVET, RVD, and RVW
improved correlation for %VC (r = -0.80), %RVol, r = +0.82, and
clinical score, r = -0.84. Patients in overt right heart failure
exhibited elevated RPEP/RVET (mean = 0.48) when compared to patients
not in right heart failure (mean = .33). Marked diminution of LV
function was present in two patients. A variety of cardiovascular
abnormalities were demonstrated echographically and were valuable in
assessing the degree of cardiac involvement in patients with cystic
fibrosis.

Texto: Ten of fifteen cystic fibrosis children with positive skin prick
tests to common antigens gave an immediate bronchial reaction to the
antigen inhaled, five of them also gave a late reaction; however only
one gave a history of asthma. The antigen most commonly eliciting a
positive skin reaction in cystic fibrosis patients is Aspergillus
fumigatus. In six children tested to this antigen the bronchial
response varied, two were negative, one gave an immediate reaction
and three gave a dual (immediate and late) reaction. None of the
children showed the characteristic pattern of response to exercise
seen in asthmatic patients, an initial rise in Peak Expiratory Flow
Rate followed by a fall of greater than 14% below the resting level.
Two patients showed an abnormal rise in Peak Expiratory Flow Rate
during exercise, a pattern described previously in cystic fibrosis.
The results suggest that bronchial allergy, immediate or late does
completely explain susceptibility to asthma, and that other factors
including perhaps the type of bronchial reactivity shown by
bronchoconstriction after exercise may be required. However the
majority of the children tested had bronchial allergy and anti-
allergy therapy such as inhaled sodium cromoglycate may have a place
in the management of selected patients with cystic fibrosis.

Texto: On exposure to pancreatic extract (PE), four parents of cystic
fibrosis (CF) children developed immediate hypersensitivity-like
symptoms: i.e. rhinoconjunctivitis, asthma, and/or anaphylaxis. IgE
to PE was demonstrated in the subjects by skin testing, leucocyte
histamine release and radioallergosorbent test (RAST). No serum
precipitating antibodies were found. Bronchial challenge caused an
immediate asthmatic response. No delayed asthmatic response or
hypersensitivity pneumonitis-like reaction occurred. The responsible
antigen for PE induced asthma is unknown; trypsin failed to inhibit
PE-RAST and is therefore not responsible in these subjects. Caution
should be exercised in using PE for skin testing and bronchial
challenge in subjects with suspected hypersensitivity to PE. Certain
measures were found useful in preventing the occurrence of symptoms
in the four subjects.

1.5 to 15 years, from a general medical practice, 48 healthy infants,
ages one to five years, from local day nurseries, and 150 healthy
babies, ages less than one to eight days. Comparative data were from
300 acutely ill hospitalized babies and children, ranging in age from
less than one day to 15 years and without clinical evidence for small-
bowel disease and bacterial overgrowth syndrome. No false-negative

10 patients whose urinary excretion of the analyte was considered to
be abnormal were patients with Giardia lamblia infestation, ileal
resection with blind loop, and other diseases of the small intestine
associated with bacterial overgrowth. We conclude that measurement of
4-hydroxyphenylacetic acid excretion is useful in screening for such

It behooves all clinical laboratory directors to re-examine and

required for full activity and the kinetics of thiol activation were
different for the control and cystic fibrosis enzyme. The properties
and lysosomal distribution of the enzyme indicated that it was a

the fall and rise in activity with subculture, the cyclical pattern

Texto: Serum from 95 patients with cystic fibrosis and 47 control subjects
without cystic fibrosis was analyzed for carboxypeptidase B-like
activity in the presence of optimal concentrations of Co2+ ion,
hippuryl-L-lysine and serum.  Fourteen of the cystic fibrosis
patients had no steatorrhea and therefore minimal pancreatic
dysfunction.  Patients with cystic fibrosis and controls were of
comparable age.  Serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity was
significantly decreased in cystic fibrosis patients including cystic
fibrosis patients without steatorrhea.  Significantly low values
were found in both male and female cystic fibrosis patients when
compared with controls of similar sex.  Although values were
unaffected by age in the control population, values in older
patients with cystic fibrosis were significantly lower than values
in younger patients.  No correlation was obtained between serum
carboxypeptidase B-like activity and pulmonary or hepatic function.
Serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity therefore falls with
progression of the disease and may limit the ability to degrade
circulating peptides in older patients with cystic fibrosis.
Deficient serum carboxypeptidase B-like activity is less likely,
however, to be a factor in the development of the early
manifestations of the disease.

exist for this increased virulence of pseudomonas, including
secretions of toxic exoproducts and a high degree of antibiotic

experience with this organism are uncertain.  The current interest in
pseudomonas infection is partly due to the ever-increasing numbers of

that bear a resemblance to those of essential fatty acid deficiency.
We fed a group of patients essential fatty acids orally since
intravenous administration is not a practical method for long term

was noted in all patients, there were no consistent clinical changes
seen in every patient.  The oral EFA therapy effected no change in
sputum cultures.  After one year of EFA, the sweat sodium
concentration was lower in all but one patient.  The clinical aspect
of our study is small, but promising.  The results suggest a role for
EFAs in the care of CF.  Whether EFA is a factor in the etiology of
CF or merely a manifestation of malabsorption requires further

maximum expiratory flow rates (Vmax) at lower volume levels were
assessed, as well as the "specific" conductance of the respiratory
pathways (Gaw/TGV), the vital capacity (VC), total lung capacity
(TLC), residual volume (RV), functional residual capacity (FRC),
RV/TLC and FRC/TLC ratios and the one-second forced expiration of the
vital capacity (FEV1) to evaluate obstruction of the respiratory
pathways. Most markedly and most frequently abnormal were the values
of Vmax, RV and of the RV/TLC ratio. These findings revealed that in
almost all patients with CF there was already during the initial
examination an obstruction of the peripheral respiratory pathways and
hyperinflation of the lungs. During repeated measurement of the above
values of lung function in 15 patients with cystic fibrosis during a
period of 1--5 years when the patients increased in height by 10 cm
on average, the above values did not deteriorate on average. There
was, however, an individual variability of the investigated values
during this period. The comprehensive treatment provided in our
country prevented in patients with CF a deterioration of obstruction
of the respiratory pathways during the period of investigation.

guanidinobenzoate, an active site titrant of serine proteases, has
been reported in plasma and cultivated skin fibroblasts from patients
with cystic fibrosis.  Another prenatal diagnostic test for cystic
fibrosis involves the observed resistance of patients' skin
fibroblasts to dexamethasone (a synthetic glucocorticoid) toxicity,
in comparison to normal fibroblasts.  Specific induction of alkaline
phosphatase with Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein, isoproterenol and
theophylline has been recorded in skin-derived fibroblasts from
affected patients.

Texto: Protease activity in plasma is assayed using 4-
methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzoate. The assay is modified by
carrying out the reaction in the presence and absence of benzamidine,
a competitive inhibitor of trypsin-like proteases. The parameters of
the assay are described in detail. Using this assay, our earlier
demonstration of a deficiency of protease activity in plasma of
patients with cystic fibrosis is confirmed. The activity, corrected
for the nonspecific hydrolysis of 4-
methylumbelliferylguanidinobenzoate by benzamidine, is expressed as
nanomoles of 4-methylumbelliferone released per milliliter plasma.
Under standard conditions, the activity in plasma activated with
chloroform-ellagic acid was 127.2 +/- 23.1 in 7 controls, 70.4 +/-
11.7 in 11 obligate heterozygotes, and 48.7 +/- 16.6 in 12 patients
with cystic fibrosis. Identical results were obtained when
unactivated plasma was used. These data demonstrate that the
judicious use of specific inhibitors such as benzamidine might be
useful in assaying low levels of protease activity in crude systems.

Texto: To nine cystic fibrosis patients with chronic bronchopulmonary
infection of severely damaged lungs invaded by Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, eleven courses of prolonged tobramycin treatment (5
mg/kg/day) for four to 16 weeks were administered. Pulmonary symptoms
improved and a better quality of life was achieved in all but one
patient. Objective parameters (chest X-ray, pulmonary function tests)
changed to a lesser extent. In only one patient was Pseudomonas
eradicated from the sputum but reappeared after discontinuation of
therapy. In the rest of the patients Pseudomonas was significantly
suppressed or replaced by other pathogens. Four patients showed rises
of antibody titres to Candida and two to Aspergillus fumigatus. No
nephrotoxic side effects were observed, but vestibular function was
reversibly impaired in one patient without corresponding clinical
symptoms. No bacterial resistance to tobramycin was observed during
therapy.

Texto: Clinical and radiological findings, quantified by special scores, in
36 patients with cystic fibrosis are compared with lung function
measurements, including the ratio of RV/TLC and FEV/VC and the
arterial blood gases at rest and during exercise. Although
respiratory function tests were found to correlate well with both the
pulmonary finding score and the chest radiographic score, distinction
of three severity groups was possible only by a vector calculation of
the blood gases in PaO2-PaCO2-diagram, at rest and during exercise.
Thus, measurements of pO2 and pCO2 at rest and on exercise appear to
be a helpful adjuvant to routine spirometry for the individual
appraisal of the degree of lung involvement, performance and care
level.

Texto: Quantitative and functional assessments were made of both the
classical and alternative pathways of complement activation in sera
from 23 patients with cystic fibrosis. The classical pathway
functioned similarly in patients and controls as measured by CH50
titre. Alternative pathway function, initiated in patient sera by
incubation with inulin, was equal to that of controls as determined
by cleavage of Factor B and C3, and by the consumption of terminal
components. Factor B, however, was more readily activated in patient
than in control sera. This rapid alteration of Factor B did not lead
to accelerated or more extensive activation of the terminal
complement components via the alternative pathway when assessed by C3
cleavage and the consumption of terminal components. Thus, a
complement deficiency was not found. The importance of the easily
activated Factor B is undefined.

the plasma of 162 hospital patients with various disorders and in the
plasma of 67 pregnant women. In pregnancy, iSP was undetectable in
40% women as compared to 12% in other hospital patients. The mean iSP
plasma level in pregnancy was 37.8 +/- 4.6 (SEM) as compared to 77.1

earlier observations based on bioassay, suggesting that the blood of
pregnant women contains higher concentrations of a SP-inactivating
factor. Of the hospital patients, elevated levels of iSP were found
in patients with chronic leukaemia, in one patient with a basaloid
carcinoma of the anus, and in one patient with toxic liver damage and
pancreatic insufficiency. No correlation was found between thyroid
function and iSP plasma levels. ISP plasma levels in various
gastrointestinal disorders were similar to those found in normal

attempt to discern the cystic fibrosis (CF) serum "factor," was
evaluated using sera from patients with pancreatic disease.  The
data suggest other pancreatic diseases, specifically genetic
diabetes and alcoholic pancreatitis, also present with a serum
"factor" (or "factors") which reduce the short circuit current of
rat jejunum, an effect very similar to that of the CF serum
"factor."  A large number of sera from presumed normal subjects also
exhibited a significant reduction in short circuit current; these
(false positives) represent a yet to be defined mechanism, however,
they do decrease the likelihood that the observed effect is merely
due to pancreatic destruction.  Detailed procedure and equipment

found to be impaired in cystic fibrosis patients with advanced
clinical disease. The responses to Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia
marcescens, and Proteus mirabilis were studied in a similar group of
cystic fibrosis patients and normal individuals. Cystic fibrosis
patients found to be unresponsive to pseudomonas were also
unresponsive to klebsiella, serratia, and proteus. Responsiveness to
Staphylococcus aureus was not impaired in cystic fibrosis patients.
We postulate that in vitro lymphocyte responses to several gram-
negative bacteria require the function of a lymphocyte subpopulation
which may be impaired in some cystic fibrosis patients.

Texto: The bacteriological effect of chemotherapy against mucoid strains of
Pseudominas aeruginosa in the lower respiratory tract of patients
with cystic fibrosis is reported. A comparison of the effect of high
doses of tobramycin (10 mg/kg/24 h) given alone or in combination
with carbenicillin showed a significant difference in favour of the
combination therapy. In 74.5% of the initially successful courses the
patients were recolonized within one month. Fifty-three patients were
examined by audiometric and vestibular tests. Only in one patient was
it possible to register a transient, high tone hearing impairment at
8000 Hz bilaterally, that might be attributed to the tobramycin
treatment. It is concluded that high dose tobramycin treatment in
children and adolescents with normal kidney function implies only a
minimal clinical risk of adverse ototoxic effects, even after
repeated courses of treatment. No nephrotoxic side-effects were found
in this material.

which is believed to be caused by defective cilia and to review some
data on the occurrence of abnormal cilia, evidently formed in
response to environmental insults.  The cilium, human ciliated
structures, the immotile-cilia syndrome and other inborn ciliary

structures are discussed.  Ciliary activity is not vital, but its
loss will cause a great deal of discomfort.  The greatest problems
relate to the lower respiratory tract, which is also a site of most
of the cilia in the body.  It is striking that a certain degree of
clearance can be maintained in the lungs in the absence of motile
cilia by coughing, hawking, and other mechanisms.

Texto: Three main reasons have been advanced for the degree of ignorance
and confusion surrounding epidemiologic measures of the incidence
and prevalence of Cystic Fibrosis. (CF)  Relatively recent
recognition of CF as a specific disease entity.  Wide range of
clinical manifestations, presentation as a multisystem disease, and
great natural variation in the severity of involvement of various
organs.  Past difficulty in establishing a diagnosis based on sound
laboratory evidence, this being largely due to the lack of a
screening test that had gained wide acceptance among diagnosticians,
and inaccuracies in the performance and interpretation of the sweat
test.  In addition to these factors, there are a number of
methodological deficiencies and questionable assumptions in several
of the papers that have here been reviewed.  It may be noteworthy
that the two sets of authors whose research design most closely
matched being aimed at providing multiple ascertainment of cases and
cross-checks of validity, have arrived at nearly the same estimated
incidence of this particular disorder (1/3700 and 1/3800
respectively).  The issue of selection and diagnostic criteria is
one that has important implications for epidemiologic studies of
cystic fibrosis.  Particularly in a disease like CF, where the
spectrum of clinical manifestations and severity of involvement is
so broad, estimates of incidence will vary according to the criteria
by which cases are ascertained and included.  A greater degree of
uniformity in standards than has been employed in previous studies
is necessary before comparisons can meaningfully be made.  There are
good grounds for regarding most estimates of CF incidence to be
minimum confirmed figures, and this is particularly so where the
research design ensures that multiple ascertainments of the same
case will be identifiable.  Higher estimates are made where several
sources of error (respondent bias, generalization of hospital data
to the wider population, multiple ascertainments of the same
patient) are not recognised.

Texto: The impact of the death of a cystic fibrosis child on subsequent
family function was evaluated in a retrospective study of 16
families.  In findings similar to that reported for another model of
fatal childhood illness, leukemia, there was a high incidence of
emotional and medical problems in the parents.  There was an
unexpectedly high incidence (7/16) of incomplete mourning, i.e.,
maintenance of the child's room as a shrine or weekly grave visit
for more than six months.  Siblings had less difficulty in adjusting
to the loss than that reported for the siblings of leukemic
children.  It is suggested that the prolonged course of a disease
with a hopeless prognosis prepares the family for the child's death
but also retards the mourning process.  The family may need
counseling to ensure that mourning is completed.

Texto: Factors that influence hemoglobin (Hb)Aic synthesis by intact
erythrocytes were studied in vitro.  After incubation cells were
lysed, and hemoglobins were separated by isoelectric focusing on
polyacrylamide slab gels and quantitated by microdensitometry.
HbAic increased with time, glucose concentrations (5-500 mM) and
incubation temperature (4 degrees-37 degrees C).  Low temperatures
allowed prolonged incubations with minimal hemolysis.  At 4 degrees
C HbAic increased linearly with time for 6 wk; after incubation at
the highest glucose concentration, HbAic comprised 50% of total
hemoglobin.  Insulin (1 and 0.1 mU/ml) did not affect HbAic
synthesis in vitro.  In addition to glucose, galactose and mannose,
but not fructose, served as precursors to HbAic.  A good substrate
for hexokinase (2-deoxy-glucose) and a poor hexokinase substrate
(3-O-methyl-glucose), were better precursors for HbAic synthesis
than glucose, suggesting that enzymatic phosphorylation of glucose
is not required for HbAic synthesis.  Autoradiography after
erythrocyte incubation with 32P-phosphate showed incorporation of
radioactivity into HbAia1 and HbAia2, but not HbAib, Aic, or A.
Acetylated HbA, generated during incubation with acetylsalicylate,
migrated anodal to HbAic and clearly separated from it.
Erythrocytes from patients with insulinopenic diabetes mellitus
synthesized HbAic at the same rate as controls when incubated with
identical glucose concentrations.  Likewise, the rate of HbAic
synthesis by erythrocytes from patients with cystic fibrosis and
congenital spherocytosis paralleled controls.  When erythrocytes
from cord blood and from HbC and sickle cell anemia patients were
incubated with elevated concentrations of glucose, fetal Hb, HbC,
and sickle Hb decreased whereas hemoglobins focusing at isoelectric
points near those expected for the corresponding glycosylated
derivatives appeared in proportionately increased amounts.

Texto: A phenotypic characterization of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from single
sputum samples of 21 typical cystic fibrosis patients indicated a
high frequency of heterogeneity among isolates on the basis of
differences in antibiotic resistance, colony morphology,
pigmentation, and serotype.  Two or more isolates with different but
stable susceptibilities to carnecillin, gentamycin, streptomycin,
tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and sulfamethoxazole plus
trimethoprim were detected in 38% of the sputa.  Differences
generally were independent of the mucoid state of the strain.  O-
antigen group determination with the Difco typing set showed that
two or more serologically distinct strains were present in 10/21
sputum specimens.  Nonmucoid derivatives of mucoid isolates almost
always retained both the antibiotic susceptibilities and serotype of
their parent strain.  These data suggest that cystic fibrosis
patients may be cocolonized/coinfected by difference strains of P.
aeruginosa more frequently than generally believed.  Alternatively,
phenotypically distinct strains from a single patient might arise as
phenotypic dissociants from a single infecting strain.  Because of
the frequency and multiplicity of phenotypically distinct P.
aeruginosa isolates which we obtained from our cystic fibrosis
patients, it is important to select multiple isolates from sputum
cultures for antimicrobial susceptibility testing so as to assess
adequately the susceptibility of this organism to antibiotic therapy
in cystic fibrosis.  We recommend that several colonies of each
distinguishable colony type of P. aeruginosa be pooled for the
antibiogram.

Texto: The dietary problems associated with the care of chronically sick
children can be considered under two broad headings.  First, there
are the problems in those children for whom diet is an essential
part of the treatment of their chronic disorder; and second there
are nutritional complications which may occur in children with
chronic diseases in which diet does not have a specific role in
treatment, and is thus often neglected or considered only at a later
stage of management.  Many of the problems are of course common to
both situations.  This paper will review briefly some of the
difficulties, illustrating these with specific examples; no attempt

metabolise certain chemicals due to an inherited enzyme deficiency.
The inborn errors of metabolism considered in this paper are those
which affect the metabolism of dietary nutrients and which require
manipulation of the carbohydrate intake.  In these cases the need for
sugar - either as a source of energy when other energy-supplying
nutrients have to be suppressed, or for the control of hypoglycaemia
- is vitally important.  Inborn errors of protein metabolism include
phenylketonuria, maple-syrup urine disease, organic acidaemias, and
hyperammonaemia.  Inborn errors of fat metabolism  include
abetalipoprotinaemia, type I lipoprotein-lipase deficiency, and
lymphangiectasia.  Inborn errors of carbohydrate metabolism include
diabetes, galactosaemia, fructosaemia, and glucose-6-phosphate
deficiency (type I glycogen storage disease).  Inborn errors of
multiple nutrients include cystic fibrosis.  Dietary carbohydrate,
psychological considerations, and dental caries are examined.

Texto: Acute pseudomonas infections require treatment with antibiotics
producing a bactericidal effect. The most useful are gentamicin,
tobramycin, sisomicin and polymyxin B. In resistant strains, amikacin
is indicated in addition. Carbenicillin, ticarcillin, carfenicillin
or azocillin should never be given alone but in combination with some
of the above preparations. Other drugs, such as chloramphenicol,
tetracycline or streptomycin, though effective in vitro, should be
avoided. Chemotherapy may be complemented by passive immunization
either with hyperimmune specific gama globulin or hyperimmune plasma.
A programmatic item of combined treatment is active immunization,
especially with toxoid vaccine. Chronic processes are not, perhaps
with the exception of urinary infections, suitable for antibiotic
therapy. For this reason effective polyvalent vaccines should be
developed from appropriate strains. It is now certain that in
infections caused by mucous strains (most frequently encountered in
cystic fibrosis) the vaccine should be prepared from these strains,
since they have distinct functional and antigenic characteristics.

Texto: Although N-acetyl-L-cysteine (Mucomyst) is an effective mycolytic,
numerous investigations have failed to demonstrate a consistent
improvement in pulmonary mechanics following its use. In order to
determine whether its beneficial mucolytic activity might be
counterbalanced by a deleterious direct effect on cilia, we studied
its effect on the activity of ciliated epithelium in the ferret
tracheal organ culture system. N-acetyl-L-cysteine consistently
caused progressive time-dependent ciliostasis at concentrations
clinically employed, with complete ciliary paralysis within 8 hr. The
effect was only partially reversed by the removal of the drug.
Control preparations retained full ciliary activity for 3 to 12
weeks. In order to determine the active site on the N-acetyl-L-
cysteine molecule, we investigated the ciliostatic effects of five of
its chemical analogs. Isomolar N-acetyl-L-alanine was not
ciliostatic, indicating the necessity of a sulfhydryl group for
activity. Ciliostasis was independent of isomeric structure,
acetylation, and chain length, as evidenced by the similar
ciliostatic effects of L-cysteine, D-cysteine, 2-mercaptoethylamine,
and N-acetyl-L-homocysteine. We conclude that N-acetyl-L-cysteine
induces partially reversible ciliostasis of tracheal epithelium via
its sulfhydryl group; prolonged use of this drug may impair
mucociliary clearance.

at the frequency of HLA types in patients with CF and have failed to
demonstrate a strong association.  We attempted to look for linkage
between HLA haplotypes and CF in families with more than one affected

unlikely that a close linkage exists between the HLA loci and the CF

Texto: Mitchell and co-workers conclude that bronchial hyperreactivity is
common in cystic fibrosis (CF) but is different from that in asthma.
Their data were interesting, but I do not agree with their
conclusion.  One can interpret these data as suggesting a common
reversible component in both patient groups, and perhaps a common
denominator in mechanism.  Because of certain problems with baseline
measurements and withholding of medication, it seems that the
conclusion of Mitchell et al may not be well supported. - We felt
justified in studying those patients with a low baseline FEV (forced
expiratory volume in one second), since a subject's bronchial
response to methacholine remains stable even if these is moderate
fluctuation both in initial specific airway conductance and in the
severity of the disease.  We feel that withholding the drug for a
longer period would not have affected the comparisons.  Although
there might be a common underlying mechanism in bronchial
hyperreactivity in asthma and cystic fibrosis, our data showed a
number of differences between the two groups of patients.  Although
these differences would not exclude a common mechanism in bronchial
hyperreactivity in the two diseases, the existence of the differences
should lead to caution in concluding that there is a common
underlying mechanism in the bronchial hyperreactivity in the two
diseases.

4-(N-acetyl-L-tyrosyl)aminobenzoic acid in children with cystic

In children with cystic fibrosis the mean values were 5.6% in the

exocrine insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis were studied to
determine whether cimetidine would improve dietary fat and nitrogen
absorption. When a constant diet was consumed and oral pancreatic
enzymes were administered, the addition of cimetidine (150 or 200 mg
taken orally one-half hour before meals) signficantly reduced fecal
fat excretion from 25.3 +/- 2.9 to 17.3 +/- 2.1 gm/24 hours and fecal
nitrogen excretion from 4.5 +/- 0.6 to 3.4 +/- 0.5 gm/24 hours (P
less than 0.05). Lower doses of cimetidine resulted in less
significant reductions of steatorrhea and azotorrhea. Cimetidine may

Texto: Davidson et al report hyperuricemia in cystic fibrosis patients
ingesting large quantities of pancreatic extracts.  This article and
others emphasize the considerable purine content of these
preparations as causal to the increased serum and urine uric acid
levels in patients who consume them.  This may find clinical
application, since uric acid production from RNA might be decreased
by an inhibitor of ribonuclease.  While itself a purine chain,
polyadenylic acid added to pancreatic extracts may prevent the
hydrolysis of mixed-base ribonucleic acid to uric acid precursors,
while allowing the beneficial effects of the other pancreatic enzymes
to prevail. - A number of weaknesses to the proposal bears stressing
before we begin giving polyadenylic acid to our patients.  No one
knows whether nucleic acids are malabsorbed in cystic fibrosis.  If
polyadenylic acid produces only 70% inhibition of pancreatic
ribonucleases at a one-to-one ratio of substrate and inhibitor, a
relatively enormous amount of polyadenylic acid would have to be fed
with the pancreatic extracts.  If there were an intestinal enzyme
capable of cleaving polyadenylic acid, the treatment would add to,
not subtract from, the purine load.  Finally, Stapleton et al's
results suggest that more than 75% of the purine load in the
pancreatic extracts would probably be absorbed anyway.

heterogeneity of cystic fibrosis and to the fact that a properly
performed sweat test in the normal or borderline range does not rule
out cystic fibrosis.  This may occur in approximately 1% of patients
we classify as having cystic fibrosis and confirms our original
impression that the sweat test has a reliability of between 98% and
99%.  One must pay close attention to the clinical picture, the
family history, and especially the pulmonary or gastrointestinal
findings, and provide rational treatment until more acceptable
evidence of the disease can be documented.  In the same issue is a
report on a false positive sweat test in a Canadian patient with the
Mauriac syndrome.  The authors list a variety of conditions that have
been reported as yielding elevated sweat electrolytes.  The manner of
the collections can greatly influence the result. - In patients with
transient abnormal sweat electrolytes, sodium values were
consistently higher than chloride values.  Perhaps the finding of
sodium values in excess of chloride in the abnormal range suggests a
false positive test.

patients was investigated by determining serum levels of
25-hydroxycholecalciferol.  The majority of the patients with CF and
pancreatic insufficiency had levels of 25-OH-D within the normal
range.  Clinical symptoms or pathologic signs resulting from
deficiencies of vitamins A and E in patients with CF have been
repeatedly documented.  In contrast, a paradoxical lack of vitamin D
deficiency signs has been observed in CF patients.  This is
especially puzzling since rickets had been commonly associated with
most other forms of steatorrhea.  We can only speculate why rickets
was formerly rarely reported in association with CF.  Perhaps because
of voracious appetites and the selective absorption of vitamin D via
the lymphatics without requiring esterification, these individuals
were spared clinical rickets.

secondary hyperparathyroidism, and a 14% decrease in bone mass
measured by the photon absorption technique. Currently accepted modes
of pancreatic enzyme replacement and vitamin D supplementation are
often inadequate to maintain normal mineral homeostasis in CF

of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin.  Ergocalciferol (vitamin D2) is
a product of plant ergosterol.  We studied the vitamin D status of
patients with cystic fibrosis by measurement of the serum
concentrations of the major circulating metabolites of vitamin D:
25-hydroxyvitamin D and 24,25-dihydroxyvitamin D.  The mean serum
concentrations of total 25OHD, 25OHD3, and 24,25(OH)2D and
25OHD3/25OHD ratios in patients with cystic fibrosis were similar to
values recorded in control subjects.  The present study demonstrates
that the serum concentrations of the major metabolites of vitamin D
in patients with cystic fibrosis are similar to those in healthy
subjects.

Texto: This paper presents additional evidence of the variability and
independence of the involvement of the sweat glands in cystic
fibrosis.  A case report of an infant girl, who died at age 9 years
of progressive pulmonary disease, is presented.  The case indicates
that fatal cystic fibrosis, or a variant thereof, can exist with
normal levels of sweat chloride and that the pulmonary disease
develops independently of the functional abnormality of the sweat
glands.

Texto: The cardiac function of 21 patients with cystic fibrosis was studied
using radionuclides and M-mode echocardiography. The patients (mean
age 13.2 years, range 4 to 27) had a wide range of clinical and
pulmonary function abnormalities (mean Shwachman-Kulczycki score
62.1). Decreased right ventricular ejection fraction was found in 13
of 18 patients (72%); an additional four patients had abnormal septal
motion on ECHO. Left ventricular ejection fraction was abnormal at
rest in four patients (19%); an additional four patients had
borderline low LVEF. The LV pre-ejection period to ejection time
ratio increased significantly (i.e., worsening LV performance) with
deterioration of S-K score, chest radiograph score, and forced
expiratory volume in 1 second. Three of eight patients with normal
LVEF at rest had an abnormal response to supine bicycle exercise:
LVEF fell in two patients and was unchanged in one. Thus evidence of
LV dysfunction was observed in seven of 21 (33%) of the patients;
four at rest and in three only during exercise.

to plan and monitor aminoglycoside therapy, and we have often noted
what appeared to be an extremely rapid elimination rate of gentamicin
in our patients with cystic fibrosis.  The patients with cystic
fibrosis had significantly greater renal and total clearances than
those without cystic fibrosis.  If this observation could be extended
to other drugs (such as the aminoglycosides), which are not normally
subject to renal secretion, it would prove intriguing evidence for a
possible primary renal defect in these patients.

Texto: The effects of oral administration of cephalexin were evaluated in a
double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study in 17 patients
with mild to moderate pulmonary disease due to cystic fibrosis.  For
two years, four-month periods with cephalexin were alternated with
four-month placebo periods.  Thus, patients served as their own
control subjects.  Fungal vulvovaginitis occurred in two patients
during cephalexin therapy.  During the 2 years of study, the rate of
colonization with mucoid strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased
and disease severity deteriorated in patients initially colonized
with P. aeruginosa.  Short-term courses of sputum culture-specific
antibiotics improved the course of some patients with mild to
moderate pulmonary disease due to cystic fibrosis.  Treatment with
cephalexin decreased the frequency of respiratory illnesses,
respiratory illnesses requiring antibiotics, and hospitalizations
for respiratory illnesses in patients initially colonized with
Staphylococcus aureus and/or Haemophilus influenzae, and also
reduced colonization with these organisms.  Improved weight gain in
16 of 17 patients was associated with periods of cephalexin therapy.
Pulmonary function tests remained stable or improved in 10 or 14
patients.  Disease severity improved in patients not colonized with
P. aeruginosa.

Texto: Cystic fibrosis as a specific disease entity has been known to be
associated with malnutrition for almost half a century. The
importance of the malnutrition in the disease process remains
unknown, as does much information about specific nutritional
deficiencies in CF. Supplements for children with CF should include
extra energy as fat or carbohydrate, a form of linoleic acid that can
be absorbed, hydrolyzed protein, fat-soluble vitamins with vitamins A
and E in a water emulsion, vitamin B12, probably B vitamins and
vitamin C, and trace minerals. Routine measurements of nutritional
status, particularly in children with growth failure, should be made
at regular intervals and should include a three-day diet record and a
simultaneous 72-hour stool fat determination. If fat malabsorption is
not controlled by pancreatic enzymes, the use of antacids or
cimetidine should be considered. The true role of nutrition in
patients with CF will not be known until the appropriate studies are
completed.

Texto: Patients with cystic fibrosis have fat malabsorption, providing an
experimental model for evaluation of the hypothesis that a low-fat
intake may prevent atherosclerosis. We studied the frequency and
extent of aortic precursor lesions (fatty streaks, early
fibromusculoelastic lesions, late fibromusculoelastic lesions) found
at autopsy in this disease as well as in other patients with
debilitating disorders but with no apparent impairment of fat
absorption. Fatty streaks were less common in the cystic fibrosis
group, as were the late fibromusculoelastic lesions. There was no
significant difference in the frequency, length, or thickness of the
early fibromusculoelastic lesions. The findings suggest that fat may
be responsible for progression but not initiation of the
fibromusculoelastic precursor lesions, and support the concept that
early restriction of dietary fat may prevent, delay, or otherwise
modify atherosclerosis in the adult.

urinary PABA recovery in healthy controls and CF patients, with no
overlap of the ranges, and a good correlation with fecal chymotrypsin

group.  In studying a group of healthy newborn infants, however, the
results were quite different: The PABA recovery was smaller and
showed greater variations and overlap with results in CF patients
occurred.  It is clear that the test is not applicable in newborn
infants when performed in the described manner.  One possible
explanation is the physiologically limited glomerular filtration rate
in the newborn infant, which could have delayed the PABA excretion.

Three of these patients did not have fibrocystic disease. Eight
patients were cured by a Gastrografin enema. There were 18 patients

meconium ileus. Eleven of these underwent resection and six patients
died. Twelve patients were treated by laparotomy, ileotomy through a
purse-string suture and prolonged irrigations using acetylcysteine.
Of this group only one succumbed. This latter course of management is
recommended for patients with simple uncomplicated meconium ileus as
it involves no resection, no enterostomy, nor any primary

Texto: The total active transport of Cl ions across the frog's gastric
mucosa can be considered as: net Cl- flux (serosa to mucosa) = H+ +
SSC (short-circuit current), all terms expressed as micromole cm-2
hr-1.  The net chloride flux (Hogben, 1955; Durbin  Heinz, 1958)
may be divided into two fractions: an acidic one which is equivalent
to the acid secreted and an electromotive one which accounts for the
gastric electromotive force.  The changes in SCC can accordingly be
used as a partial index to the activity of the chloride pump.
Experiments were designed to investigate the effects of histamine,
metiamide (H2 receptor antagonist), cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF
plasma on the above parameters using the frog's isolated gastric
mucosa.  The SCC and the resistance of the mucosal preparation is
measured by means of an automatic SCC apparatus (de Jesus, 1977).
The H ion secretion is measured by pH meter.  Results obtained
(expressed as mean change (delta) plus or minus S.E. of mean) for
histamine (10-4 M) (n = 10) show an initial increase of the SCC by
36.94 plus or minus 2.95 microA cm-2 and a parallel small increase
in H+ output by 0.045 plus or minus 0.003 micromole cm-2 hr-1.  This
initial increase in SCC is followed by a drop to a steady-state
level of 23.62 plus or minus 2.23 microA cm-2 and also by a large
increase in H+ secretion 2.26 plus or minus 0.22 micromole cm-2
hr-1.  These results support the work of Rehm (1961) in that
histamine has an effect first on the Cl- pump and then on the H+
secretion.  Metiamide (10-4 M) (n = 12) caused a drop in the SCC by
20.16 plus or minus 2.32 microA cm-2 and also reduced the acid
secretion by 2.21 plus or minus 0.14 micromole cm-2 hr-1, thus
suggesting an effect on the Cl- pump as well as on the H+ secretion.
Significant differences are shown (P < 0.001) between CF and non-CF
plasma results.  The CF plasma (n = 8) increased the SCC by 17.25
plus or minus 2.94 microA cm-2 and H+ secretion by 2.38 plus or
minus 0.43 micromole cm-2 hr-1.  Non-CF plasma caused a slight
increase in SCC by 5.17 plus or minus 1.1 microA cm-2 and had little
effect on the H+ secretion, 0.34 plus or minus 0.01 micromole cm-2
hr-1 (n = 8).  The effect of the CF plasma on the Cl- and H+
mechanism is of interest since in cystic fibrosis there is an
abnormal increase of Cl- and Na+ in the sweat of patients (di Sant
Agnese, Darling, Perera  She, 1953).
Recordnum: 01121
Texto: Schulz (1969) showed that the raised Na concentration in the sweat
of children suffering from cystic fibrosis  was due to a defect in
Na reabsorption in the duct epithelium, but somewhat surprisingly
the transepithelial potential difference (p.d.) is the same as that
in normal controls.  Na transport is also reduced in the chronically
ligated salivary duct of the rabbit submandibular gland (Fraser 
Smaje, 1978), and because p.d. is unaffected, the ligated gland may
be a useful model of this aspect of cystic fibrosis.  Here we would
like to report a further similarity to cystic fibrosis; duct
ligation leads to goblet cell hyperplasia which also occurs in the
salivary glands in cystic fibrosis (Lev  Spicer, 1965).  Sections
of the salivary duct 6 microm thick were taken at 60 microm
intervals from ducts which had been ligated for between 1 and 5
weeks and from their contralateral controls following fixation by
immersion.  Ligation resulted in an increase in luminal diameter by
distension of the previously convoluted epithelium, but there was no
significant change in epithelial surface area.  The number of cell
layers appeared to have increased however and there was a
proliferation of goblet cells.  The mucus in these cells was stained
by alcian blue at pH 1 indicating the presence of sulphomucin.  The
mean goblet cell density rose from 7.62 plus or minus 4.73 mm-2
(mean plus or minus S.E. of the mean, n = 6) in controls to 114 plus
or minus 49.6 in ligated ducts.  The transepithelial Na flux in the
same ducts was reduced from 10.1 plus or minus 0.79 n-mole cm-2
sec-1 to 1.6 plus or minus 0.84 while p.d. remained at -22 mV,
similar to those results previously reported.  There was no
significant correlation between the degree of diminution of Na
transport and the density of goblet cells but there was a positive
correlation (r = 0.90) between the number of goblet cells in the
control and contralateral ligated ducts.

radioimmunoassay in normal subjects and patients with various
diseases of the pancreas. The normal range is 115-350 ng/ml with a
geometric mean of 212 ng/ml. No trypsin was found in serum after
total duodenopancreatectomy, in about 75% of patients with cystic
fibrosis and in a few patients with pancreas carcinoma or chronic
pancreatitis. Reduced serum trypsin levels between 10 and 100 ng/ml
were measured in the remaining 25% of cystic fibrosis and in one
third of the patients with chronic pancreatitis. Serum trypsin was
increased to 700-17,000 ng/ml in all patients with acute pancreatitis
or during the acute phase of chronic pancreatitis. Absent or reduced
serum trypsin is a reliable indicator of total or partial exocrine
pancreatic insufficiency whereas considerably increased serum trypsin
concentration do indicate acute pancreatitis.

Nine polyps from seven cystic fibrosis (CF) patients could be

hyalinization, lack of extensive infiltration of eosinophils (Giemsa
stains), and a preponderance of acid mucin in glands and cysts of the
polyp and in its surface mucous blanket (Alcian Blue-periodic acid-
Schiff stains). Two polyps from two patients with CF and atopy showed
the characteristic findings of CF without modification. Eight polyps
from four atopic patients without CF were identified by the reverse
triad of changes: extensive thickening of the epithelial basement
membrane and its extension into the submucosa as an irregular hyaline
membrane, high stromal eosinophil count, and mainly neutral mucin in
mucous glands, cysts, and mucous blanket. Hyperplastic mucous glands,
mucous cysts of variable sizes, focal metaplasia of surface
epithelium, and acid mucin in goblet cells were considered
nonspecific lesions.

The low value for the 94 week infant is consistent with their finding
that, in children with low pancreatic enzyme output, the increased
IRT results are restricted to the first few months of life.  It
remains to be proved whether older CF patients with residual
pancreatic enzyme secretion do indeed continue to have increased IRT
levels.  If they do, the IRT test would also deserve further
investigation as a tool, to be used in conjunction with stool
pancreatic enzyme activity, in smaller centres who have had problems

dependence in controls older than 20 years, those under 20 had much
increased SACE values.  We feel that it is inappropriate to evaluate
SACE activity in patients under 20 years old with diagnostic criteria
determined in adults. - Dr Romer and colleagues reported high
activities of SACE in 3 patients out of 10 with chronic granulomatous
disease (CGD) and concluded that "CGD is associated with increased
levels of SACE".  Unfortunately, Romer et al. did not study an
adequate paedeatric age control group, and their mean values are
compared primarily with that in 5 children with cystic fibrosis.  Our
most recent studies confirm our earlier observation that children
under the age 19 years definitely have higher mean SACE values than
do adults.  Cystic-fibrosis patients should not be used for
comparison since they tend to have lower SACE levels than comparable
aged controls.  In my opinion patients with CGD, according to the
data published by Romer et al., show no increase in SACE levels for
their age.

Texto: For several reasons the supernatant fraction of amniotic fluid is not
often used in the prenatal detection of inborn errors of metabolism.
In early pregnancy the bulk of the protein in amniotic fluid is
derived from the maternal circulation, and this can obscure the more
critical contribution from the fetus needed for prenatal diagnosis.
10 - 30% of amniotic fluids are significantly contaminated with
maternal blood, and if the enzyme in question is present in this
blood (as 4-methylumbelliferyl guanidinobenzoate [MUGB] protease is),
this can further distort diagnostic conclusions.  For this reason we
have examined the variation of MUGB protease in a heterogenous
collection of amniotic fluids.  No significant differences in titre
between individual weeks in the second trimester were observed.  A
further 104 second-trimester amniotic fluids from pregnancies with
abnormal outcome were also investigated.  The means of the four
groups were not significantly different from that of the normals and
the ranges were very similar.  We have not yet had the opportunity to
examine an amniotic fluid from a known case of cystic fibrosis.
Diagnosis of cystic fibrosis could probably be further refined by
coupling amniotic-fluid protease titration and isoelectric focusing
on polyacrylamide gel.

following hypothesis: since lack of antitrypsin is associated with
lung damage, plasma-trypsin in excess of antitrypsin might be
responsible for the lung damage in cystic fibrosis.  General protease
and trypsin levels were measured spectrophotometrically using a
modification of the method of Erlanger, Kojowsky and Cohen.  Our
result showed no significant difference between protease and trypsin

the differing measuring technique used.  Our trypsin levels were

of positive skin-prick tests to environmental allergies.  In the
normal population only about half those with positive prick tests

skin-tests of cystic fibrosis clinically important?  In particular,
do they mean a high prevalence of asthma, overt or hidden, amongst

more frequent amongst cystic fibrosis than in the normal population.
The often positive skin tests, although of considerable immunological

out of the 29 patients with abnormal IRT was the concentration
supranormal.  Our data suggest that low IRT concentrations are an
excellent index of diminished pancreatic reserve in CF and that
serum-IRT concentration would be a useful diagnostic test.  The fact
that CF patients at birth invariably have very high IRT
concentrations which fall with age and the progress of the disease,
allied with the fact that heterozygotes have high concentrations,
supports the previous suggestion that an uncontrolled hypersecretion
of zymogen granules is the basic cellular defect in CF.

(4-methylumbelliferyl guanidinobenzoate, a sensitive active site
titrant of many serine proteases) when plasma and cultivated skin
fibroblasts from patients with cystic fibrosis (CF), obligate
heterozygotes, and controls were compared.  Because of these
observations, and the potential value of amniotic fluid for the
prenatal detection of cystic fibrosis, these studies were extended to
human amniotic fluid obtained by amniocentesis done for the
intrauterine detection of genetic and other fetal abnormalities.  An
amniotic-fluid sample obtained from a woman who was subsequently
delivered of a baby with CF showed a much reduced level of MUGB
reactivity similar to the relative deficiency observed in plasma and
cultivated skin fibroblasts from patients with CF.  These
observations suggest that amniotic-fluid protease activity may be a
useful marker for the prenatal detection of CF.

Texto: Dr Hosli and Esther Vogt base their diagnosis of heterozygotes and
homozygotes for cystic fibrosis on the thermal stability in plasma or
extracellular fluids of alpha-mannosidase and/or phosphatase activity
assayed at pH 5.4.  The activity of alpha-mannosidase in plasma and
this pH is a composite one: both acidic alpha-mannosidase, which has
a pH optimum of 4.25 and intermediate alpha-mannosidase, which has a
pH optimum of 5.6 - 6.0, will contribute to the activity measured at
pH 5.4.  These two forms of alpha-mannosidase are structurally and
genetically distinct and have different kinetics and
thermostabilities.  Therefore the total alpha-mannosidase activity at
pH 5.4 and the physicochemical properties of this activity will
depend upon the relative proportions of the two types of
alpha-mannosidase in the sample.  The proportions of the two forms
vary widely in normal plasma, especially in plasma from children.
Although the data of Hosli and Vogt suggest that the total
alpha-mannosidase at pH 5.4 does not differ significantly between
controls, CF heterozygotes and CF homozygotes, they do not show
whether the proportions of acidic and intermediate alpha-mannosidase
have changed.  An increase in the proportion of the thermolabile
intermediate alpha-mannosidase in CF would be manifested as a
decreased thermostability of alpha-mannosidase at pH 5.4.
Alternatively a mutation in the normally stable acidic
alpha-mannosidase leading to a less stable form would also be
reflected as a decreased stability in the activity at pH 5.4,
especially if the proportion of acidic alpha-mannosidase was
increased in CF.  These situations should also be considered as
possible explanations of the observations, in addition to the one
favoured by Hosli and Vogt.

apply their findings to the prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.
We were therefore most interested in the reports on the use of
4-methylumbelliferyl-rho-guanidinobenzoate (MUGB) for assaying
arginine esterase activity in amniotic fluid.  Our results with MUGB
are similar to those of Brock and Haywood but are substantially
higher than those of Walsh and Nedler.  A sample of amniotic fluid

pro-phe-arg-4-methylcoumarinyl-7-amide (PPA-MCA) showed less than 20%
of the activity of a similarly treated control sample that had not
been incubated with MUGB.  The activity of arginine esterase towards
PPA-MCA both in amniotic fluid and in cultures amniotic fluid cells
is much greater than towards CBZ-Arg-AMC.  These levels of activity
are high enough to warrant further investigation for use in an
antenatal diagnosis.

reserpine to rats produces CF-like alterations, we have studied the
lung resistance to bacterial infections in animals treated with
reserpine.  Mice of the BALB/c inbred strain were injected
subcutaneously with different doses of reserpine for 7 days; after,
they were submitted to an infective aerosol containing
Staphylococcus aureus in a nebulization chamber.  With each pair of
exposed animals, an individual value of the uncleared bacteria ratio
(UBR) at 4 hours was obtained.  Reserpinized animals showed a
significant increase in UBR values when compared to control mice (p
< 0.05 and p < 0.01 depending on the doses), suggesting an
impairment of the lung antibacterial defenses.  Although
pharmacological doses of reserpine produce catecholamine depletion,
we can not conclude that this action upon the nervous system is the
only cause of the CF-like response we detected.  In conclusion, the
observed UBR decrease lends support to the concept of a reserpine-
induced CF animal model.

approximately 10 times that expected from recurrent mutation alone. A
decreased sialic acid content has been observed in cell surface
glycoproteins on cystic fibrosis fibroblasts and in numerous soluble
glycoprotein preparations from cystic fibrosis homozygotes. Sialic
acid residues on cell surface glycoconjugates play an essential role
in the binding and infectivity of myxoviruses and paramyxoviruses,
including those causing pandemic influenza. It is suggested that
increased resistance to these viruses conferred by similar but
quantitatively smaller alterations in sialoglycoconjugate structure
in cystic fibrosis heterozygotes may have provided a selective
advantage to maintain the high frequency of the cystic fibrosis gene
in Caucasian populations.

Texto: As the pathogenesis in cystic fibrosis (CF) has been considered to
lie in a disturbance in the behavior of secretions, particularly
mucins, from exocrine glands, it has been proposed that an alteration
in surface topography (form, number or distribution of microvilli or
blebs) of epithelial cells lining ducts could impair distribution
leading to retention of mucus leading to the clinical phenotype.
Scanning electronmicroscopy of human epithelial suspension cultures
now offers an opportunity to evaluate the role of plasmalemma
topography in CF.

Texto: Lysosomal acid hydrolases and alkaline phosphatase cooperate in the
intracellular digestion of natural polymers.  A stimulus for the
induction of these enzymes is the retention of any kind of polymer
inside the cell.  This stimulus is long-lasting and strong if
polymers are intracellularly retained because of a lack of digestive
enzymes.  In previous papers it has been demonstrated that the
alkaline phosphatase (AIP) induction with Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein
discriminates between fibroblasts of CF homozygotes on the one hand
and normals and CF carriers on the other hand, and a hypothesis has
been proposed to explain these observations.  As predicted, more
efficient inducing mixtures have since been developed; these have
been used in the present study.  The first writer familiarized
himself with ultramicrotechniques and then carried out double blind
studies on 20 fibroblast cultures from French patients.  These
findings demonstrate the reproducibility of the AIP induction and of
the methods used, and they particularly underline the importance of
employing the present ultramicrotechniques for a successful AIP
induction.  It is likely that amniotic fluid cells behave like skin
fibroblasts in this test; if this proves to be so, then the induction
of alkaline phosphatase should provide a useful technique for the
prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

Texto: Hosli has published a hypothesis relating to the primary cause of
cystic fibrosis (CF) based on his observations that the level of
alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in CF-derived skin fibroblasts, but not
fibroblasts derived from normal individuals, could be increased
several-fold by growing the cells in the presence of the urinary
glycoprotein, Tamm-Horsfall protein (THP).  However, we have not been
able to show, in Adelaide, any change or induction in the level of
ALP activity in CF-derived skin fibroblasts when grown in the
presence of locally prepared THP under what appear to be identical
cell culture conditions to those used by Hosli.  It thus appears that
under the conditions currently employed in our laboratory, there is
no diagnostic discrimination between fibroblasts of CF homozygotes
and normal individuals.

Texto: Chest physiotherapy is an important part of the treatment program of
children with cystic fibrosis, but controlled studies of its effects
are few.  27 children with cystic fibrosis, 20 being chronic sputum
producers and 7 non-sputum producers, were studied in hospital with
serial lung function tests on 3 consecutive days.  On the 1st day
physiotherapy was performed twice; on the 2nd day no physiotherapy
was performed; on the 3rd day the two periods of physiotherapy were
preceded by an inhaled bronchodilator (Rimiterol).  Lung function
tests included peak flow, forced vital capacity (FVC), forced
expiratory volume in 1 sec (FEV1.0) and residual volume to total
lung capacity ratio, and were measured at the beginning of each day
and at similar intervals throughout the 3 days.  Sputum volume and
cough frequency were noted on day 1 and day 3.  Physiotherapy
resulted in significant improvement of peak flow in the sputum
producers.  However, the FVC and FEV1.0, while improving after
physiotherapy, also improved on the control day when no
physiotherapy was performed.  This suggests that physiotherapy may
be effective in removing sputum from central large airways with
resultant improvement in peak flow, but has little added effect on
the more peripheral airways, whose airflow improves through the day
with normal activity.  No significant effect was shown in the non-
sputum producers although there was a trend towards improvement in
peak flow.  A bronchodilator before physiotherapy may be beneficial
in those patients who demonstrate significant reduction in airflow
obstruction at formal testing of bronchodilator response, but may
lessen the beneficial effects of physiotherapy in those without a
positive response.  The study illustrates the importance of
examining difference methods of chest physiotherapy, to find ways of
improving sputum clearance.

following treatment schedules on pulmonary function has been studied in
random order on 4 consecutive days: (1) clapping and postural drainage (CP);
(2) CP after inhaling an aerosol of 5 ml 20% N-acetylcysteine by a Monaghan
ultrasonic device; (3) as in 2 but with the addition of 0.5 mg isoprenaline
to the aerosol; (4) as in 3 but with an IPPB device added to the nebulizer.
Treatment was started at 9.30 a.m. and lasted for about 1 h.  Pulmonary
function was measured prior to and 30 min after treatment (9.00 and 11.00
a.m., respectively).  In 8 children (group B) with CF (severity comparable
to the previous group) pulmonary function was measured at 9.00 and 11.00 a.m.
but without physiotherapy in between.  The following pulmonary function
measurements have been included in the evaluation of the results: VC, FVC,
FEV1, TLC (body box), TLC (helium dilution), TLCBb-TLCHe, RVBb, RVHe, maximal
expiratory flows at 60% TLBBb, 25% FVC, maximal midexpiratory flow, airway
conductance.  The technique of the determinations was carefully controlled
and initial values were reproducible in most children.  In group B, mean
values of pulmonary function were equal at 9.00 and 11.00 a.m.  In group A
none of the treatment schedules caused a significant improvement of mean
pulmonary function values.  In some of the children, however, pulmonary
function improved, but in others it deteriorated. The significance of these

programme.  The aim is the development of a mechanical aid which will
enable patients with cystic fibrosis to give themselves satisfactory
physiotherapy.  The percussor, which can be used by patients, parents
or relatives, is portable and lightweight.  The domiciliary trial
showed that effective percussion could be self-administered to the
front of the chest and to a lesser extent to the sides of the chest.
The percussor was found to be very acceptable to adolescent patients
and especially girls with early breast development.  Further research
work has now been completed and as a result a system has been
developed which enables patients to treat themselves with
satisfactory chest percussion in the five preferred positions of
postural drainage.

two bronchorrheic children, who needed bronchography for diagnostic

showed the inefficacy of coughing.  The object of the present study
is to analyze the physiologic mechanism of autogenic drainage.  For
children older than five, this method is very simple and efficient
and as the effort or onset is not excessive and as expiration does
not need to be complete, autogenic drainage is not exhausting and can
be performed for a long time, which is indispensable since the
progression of secretions is slow.

fibrosis is continuously discussed.  This paper deals with the diet
for CF infants younger than one year.  The basic view is that the
diet should be as close to the 'normal baby' diet as possible, partly
to ensure normal growth and development, and partly to avoid extra
work for the families with CF infants.  Infants suffering from CF
were given lactose-free diet until they reached the age of one year.
The weight increased more rapidly than in CF patients given the
traditional CF diet with low fat and high protein.  Furthermore, it
was not necessary to give increased amounts of calories to the
infants given lactose-free diet, nor did they receive additional
fat-soluble vitamins.

Texto: This review emphasizes some of the positive accomplishments of cystic
fibrosis research, some of the puzzles and some of the recent
developments that have promise.  One of the major unresolved
questions is the maintenance of this lethal gene at such a high
frequency, perhaps because of a heterozygote advantage in the past,
no longer operative at present.  Nothing is known of the chromosomal
localization of the trait; except that chromosomes are
morphologically normal, that it is autosomal, not sex linked and that
there is no correlation with blood groups or major HLA loci.  One of
the important achievements of the past many years is that we
understand relatively well the pathogenesis of most clinical
manifestations of CF.  The as yet unknown inherited basic defect or
metabolic error of CF gives rise to two main anomalies: the
electrolyte defect in exocrine sweat glands and the 'mucous
secretion' abnormality.  While the results of tissue culture studies
often have been conflicting and disparate, it does seem to be the
consensus that the fibroblasts are affected by the basic metabolic
error in some manner, and that they respond abnormally under
different experimental circumstances.  Virtually all investigators
have found some anomalies in biologic fluids of CF, although using
different approaches and methods.  An abnormality in the function of
the autonomic nervous system, which is so closely associated with the
exocrine glands, has always been an attractive explanation for the
generalized exocrinopathy of CF.  The search for a genetic animal
model for CF has led to interesting findings.

Texto: Water, electrolyte and macromolecular secretion, which is affected in
cystic fibrosis, is regulated by neurotransmitters of the autonomic
nervous system stimulating the cells by binding to alpha-adrenergic,
beta-adrenergic and cholinergic receptors.  Therefore, a genetic
disturbance in cyclic 3'5'-adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP) response
could eventually explain some of the manifold expressions of labile
biochemical changes observed in CF, specially in tissue culture.  We
further characterized beta-receptors in cultured fibroblasts of CF
patients and normal controls and investigated isoproterenol and
prostaglandin E1-mediated c-AMP response using defined culture
conditions.  No significant difference was found between the two
phenotypes on basal c-AMP values.  With the exception of one cell
line, CF strains had 25 to 180% increased c-AMP content.  This
difference is highly significant (p < 0.0025).  This statistically
significant difference in response can neither be attributed to
differences in dose- or time-response curves nor to differential
c-AMP escape into culture medium.  Since CF cells synthesize more
c-AMP than controls only in response to isoproterenol but not to
prostaglandin E1, the alteration which might be responsible for the
observed phenomenon is probably located proximal of the adenylate
cyclase at the cells border between intra- and extracellular space.

Malabsorption of zinc, iron and manganese in exocrine pancreatic

If such relationships are established then some form of trace element

of PGE2 and PGE-alpha in the sweat.  Low concentrations of PGE1 have
less effect on platelet agglutination in CF patients and
heterozygotes than in normals, but no difference is observed when
high PG concentrations are used.  Sweat PGE2 and PGE-alpha
concentrations are similar in normals, CF patients and heterozygotes,
but sweat PGE2 concentrations are proportional to Na/Cl levels in CF,
but not in control children or heterozygotes.

Texto: Recently, one of us suggested a new hypothesis concerning the 'basic
defect' of cystic fibrosis.  The purpose of the present paper is to
review this model and to critically discuss its eventual diagnostic
applications.  With extensive studies, we collected experimental data
which contribute five major arguments in favour of the proposition
that CF may be an enzyme recognition site mutant.  With fibroblast
cultures the three genotypes can be separated in the following way:
CF homozygote, leaky for alkaline phosphatase (A1P) and lysosomal
hydrolases/A1P is Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein (THP) inducible; CF
heterozygote, leaky for A1P and lysosomal hydrolases/A1P is not THP
inducible; normal control, not leaky for A1P and lysosomal
enzymes/A1P is not THP inducible.  With the exception of a second
double-blind study, the THP induction as well as the leakage analysis
seem to be statistically unequivocal: they strongly support our
hypothesis concerning the basic defect in CF.

all other glycosidases studied in CF patients were in the normal

Texto: In recent years, several workers have reported that a single 2-hour
postprandial total serum bile acid (TSBA) concentration, in a variety
of liver disease states, is a more sensitive index of deranged liver
function than are the 'conventional' serum liver function tests.
This observation seemed to us to provide a challenging situation for
the assessment of TSBA concentrations in cystic fibrosis.  The
distribution of results for the CF patients (mean TSBA concentration
27.0 micromol/l) and for the age-matched controls (mean concentration
19.9 micromol/l) shows a wider range for the CF group.  Statistical
analysis, however, of these two groups shows no significant
difference between them.  Many factors affect both the size and
distribution of the bile acid pool in CF, and a consideration of
these factors may go some way towards explaining the rather
unspectacular TSBA results.

fibrosis patients and parents living in Avon County, England.  By
examining the obligate heterozygotes (the parents), we would be able
to assess the influence of the CF gene without the presence of the
disease.  There is an increase in immediate hypersensitivity to A.
fumigatus in CF patients but not their parents.  This increased
sensitivity is probably IgE-mediated and a secondary effect of lung
damage.  There is no evidence that the CF gene produces a generalised
increase in skin reactivity (atopy), serum IgE or serum IgG4 in the
heterozygotes.  They are not therefore likely to develop asthma.

we performed investigations into the threshold dosage of
acetylcholine-induced bronchospasm in patients with various recurrent

threshold value of acetylcholine and thus an increased bronchial
reactivity could be proven in patients with cystic fibrosis in
comparison with healthy children.  The cause of bronchial
hyperreactivity in patients with CF may be due to proteases deriving
from leucocytes of the purulent sputum.  Furthermore, we investigated
the influence of terbutaline on the bronchial obstruction induced by
acetylcholine in patients with bronchial asthma and cystic fibrosis.
The groups were comparable, especially with regard to the degree of
the initial bronchial obstruction.

patients and in control children were not significantly different.
In CF patients there is no correlation between the TSH response area
and the basal level of serum T4, or with grading according to
Shwachman and Kulczycki.  We found no relation with therapy.  In
basal conditions, our data show a completely normal pattern of the
serum concentration of T4, T3, TBG and TSH in subjects with CF in
absence of iodide therapy.  Thyroid status should be examined in
patients with CF specially when they receive iodide therapy or other

Isolated communities generations ago in Europe, e.g. Bad Gastein,

Texto: An alternative method for assaying the cystic fibrosis factor could
be on the electrophysiological responses of isolated living tissues.
The ability of the frog's gastric mucosa to secrete hydrochloric acid
and maintain a negative potential difference is well known.  This
potential difference across the secretory (mucosa) to the nutrient
(serosa) side coupled with its property of transporting chloride and
hydrogen ions against an electrochemical gradient could therefore
serve as a useful model for investigating any induced changes in the
presence of CF and non-CF plasma.  From the results obtained the
short circuit current and H+ secretion responses in the presence of
CF (whole) plasma show significant increases compared to the control.
These findings show that in the presence of CF plasma, whole or
plasma fraction B, there is a marked increase in the actively
transported Cl- and H+.  The effect of CF plasma in increasing net
Cl- flux is important considering the elevation of this electrolyte
in the sweat of CF patients and deserved further investigation.

skin prick tests than normal; this may be the result of defective
antigen handling at mucosal surfaces.  Our aim was to investigate
bronchial allergy in a group of children with CF and positive skin
tests.  We studied 15 children aged 7 to 16 years with mild to
moderate respiratory disease.  Only 1 child gave a history of
wheezing not associated with chest infections and this study supports
the hypothesis that clinical asthma is a product of bronchial allergy
and broncholability.  The responses to bronchial provocation with
Aspergillus suggest that allergy to this antigen may play a part in
the pathogenesis of lung disease in some patients with CF.

Texto: We focused our study on concentration of immunoglobulins, lysozyme,
lactoferrin, some antiproteolytic fractions and acute phase proteins
in bronchial secretion of children with various pulmonary diseases,
especially with cystic fibrosis.  Secretory IgA is decreased in all
studied groups of patients having chronic or recurrent infections of
the respiratory tract (when compared to the group of healthy
children).  Groups which were characterized by the infection of the
lower part of the respiratory tract had increased lysozyme level.
The results obtained in the group of CF children are similar to those
obtained in groups with bronchiectasis and chronic bronchitis, which
suggests that the observed differences are characteristic for chronic
infection rather than for CF.  Although in CF as well as in
bronchiectasis massive bacterial infection results in increased
concentration of immunoglobulins, antiproteolytic fractions and acute
phase proteins, the results seen in both groups are somewhat
different.  These differences may indicate some difference in the
reactivity to infection of the respiratory tract in CF in comparison
to patients with bronchiectasis.  It seems conceivable that among
children with CF who have very low S-IgA, chronic respiratory tract
infections occur earlier and IgG response to permanent exposition to
variety of antigens is less vigorous.  The presented results raise
also a possibility that the bacterial infection in CF does not
stimulate defence mechanisms to the same extent as in bronchiectasis.

pulmonary inflammation takes place in the lungs of patients with
cystic fibrosis.  Plasma complement C3 levels were all normal.
Eleven of the patients with the C3 split product C3c were from the
group of 14 patients suffering from chronic infection with mucoid
strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 2 were from the group of 14 CF
patients without P. aeruginosa infection.  This difference was
significant (p < 0.002).  A comparison of albumin ratios between the
13 patients with the C3 split product C3c and the remaining other 15
patients showed a significant higher ratio in the former group (p <
0.01) on an average 4.1 versus 1.4 per cent.  The significantly
higher albumin ratio demonstrated in the patients with C3c in their
sputum sol phase supports the concept of complement-induced
inflammation with subsequent transudation of plasma proteins in these
patients.  This study thus shows that complement-mediated
inflammatory reactions may play an important role in the pathogenesis
of pulmonary tissue damage in patients with CF, even when the plasma
C3 levels are normal, and it supports the concept of chronic P.
aeruginosa lung infection as an immune complex disease in CF
patients.

we investigated parotid saliva specimens of 18 such patients.  We
compared the results with a control group of 12 healthy children of
the same age and sex.  Furthermore, children with bronchial asthma
and chronic bronchitis were examined.  The flow rate of the parotid
and the protein output without stimulation were nearly the same for
the four groups.  In patients with CF the protein output after
stimulation was significantly lower.  An increased level of sodium
was observed in the stimulated secretion and the unstimulated saliva
as well.  In CF children we found a significant higher output of
sodium in both stimulated parotid saliva and unstimulated parotid
saliva.  The IgG output of the gland after stimulation was found to
be slightly reduced in patients with CF in comparison to healthy
children.  The output of the gland for IgA after stimulation was
observed to be strongly reduced for the group with CF and for the
group with bronchial asthma.  The decreased output of the gland for
secretory IgA after stimulation was demonstrated again in CF and in
bronchial asthma in comparison with healthy persons.  The increased
sodium concentration in parotid saliva may be caused in a similar way
as the electrolyte abnormality of sweat in CF patients, namely by a
decreased net reabsorption of sodium.  Due to the result of an
increased electrolyte output and decreased immunoglobulin output of
parotid gland we can suppose that the molecular magnitude plays its
role in this disturbance.

Texto: Wallwork and co-workers have proposed that increased absorption of
antigens takes place across the mucosal membranes of the gut and
respiratory tract possibly due to a transient defect in the
production of secretory IgA.  As a consequence of this hypothesis,
one would expect cystic fibrosis patients to produce a pronounced
antibody response against the intestinal bacterial flora.  The
present work was therefore carried out to investigate the antibody
response in CF patients and in normal persons against Escherichia
coli and Bacteroides fragilis which are present in the gut in large
numbers and against the respiratory pathogen P. aeruginosa.  A
significantly higher prevalence of precipitins against each of the 3
bacterial species was found in CF patients compared to normal
persons, and the prevalence of precipitins against each of these
bacteria increased significantly with age.  As regards P. aeruginosa
precipitins, the prevalence and number was significantly higher in CF
patients who have subsequently succumbed compared to CF patients who
are still alive.  Such a correlation between the antibody response
and the prognosis of the patients was not found as regards E. coli or
B. fragilis.  Considering the hypothesis of Wallwork and co-workers
concerning increased absorption of antigens from the gut, it seems
more attractive to suppose that increased absorption of antigens from
the gut flora occurs predominantly in CF patients with P. aeruginosa
lung infection with a pronounced antibody response against P.
aeruginosa.

Texto: Several reports have indicated the presence of abnormally high
amounts of sulphate in the mucous glands of patients with cystic
fibrosis.  Bearing these facts in mind, we suspected that abnormal,
over-sulphated, and strongly anionic, glycoproteins might be involved
in the pathogenesis of CF.  The present study was carried out to
determine whether sulphated blood-group substances occur in normal
pancreatic tissue.  The distribution of sulphate over the exocrine
part of pancreas does coincide with the distribution of blood-group
substance previously observed by fluorescent microscopy.  We
therefore find it very likely that the sulphate and blood-group
substance are associated with the same glycoprotein molecule.  Since
blood-group substance has been demonstrated in many secretions in
man, and since high amounts of sulphate have been found in the
mucous glands in CF, such a mechanism is possible in many locations
and may thus offer an explanation for the multiorgan involvement in
CF.

In babies and young children cardiac insufficiency  caused by

adulthood, but we feel that a condition with such grave genetic and
prognostic implications must be diagnosed with special caution in
this age group.  In particular, the sweat test, which is the main
diagnostic tool for use with children, must be interpreted in adults
in the light of possible age-related increases in normal
sweat-electrolyte concentration and other factors that may affect the
assay.  Although it is generally accepted that "normal" sweat sodium
and chloride concentrations are higher in adults than in children,
there is no clear agreement about the upper limits of the normal

also have a substantial effect on electrolyte values.  For the
diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in adults, an attempt should thus be
made to base the diagnosis not only on "elevated" sweat-electrolyte
values and clinical impression but also on pancreatic-function data.

Texto: Reports of exocrine gland secretory anomalies in cystic fibrosis and
increased calcium ion concentrations in some CF secretions and the
importance of cellular Ca to stimulus-secretion coupling led us to
study cellular Ca in CF.  We report data on Ca uptake studies with
mitochondrial and microsomal fractions isolated from skin fibroblasts
of subjects with CF and age-, sex- and passage number-matched
controls in which mitochondria from CF cells accumulated more Ca than
those from control cells.  We also describe subsequent studies which
show increased mitochondrial electron transport activity, measured as
oxygen uptake by whole cells, in cells from subjects with CF and
obligate heterozygotes.  One can hypothesise a mechanism to link the
altered mitochondrial Ca in CF fibroblasts and the major signs
associated with the disease.  Data suggest that the electron
transport system in CF and obligate heterozygote fibroblasts is more
active than that in respective controls, in the conditions of this
study.  The apparent central role of Ca in several pathogenetic
pathways in CF and the data reported here in which both mitochondrial
Ca capacity and oxygen consumption are increased in CF suggest that
this organelle is a suitable focus for CF investigations.

Texto: Making the diagnosis of cystic fibrosis requires clinical suspicion
and sweat tests.  Physicians today are aware of the main clinical
features of pulmonary and pancreatic involvement and are suspecting
the diagnosis earlier than in past years.  The accuracy of the sweat
test is the most crucial factor in confirming the diagnosis.  The
present case illustrates this point.  The main purpose of this paper
is to serve as a reminder that the sweat test is often less than
accurate as frequently performed.  The principal pitfall of sweat
testing at present seems to be the use of a chloride electrode
applied to the skin without assurance that an adequate amount of
sweat is present.

in the physical rehabilitation of middle-aged adults with moderate to
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purpose of this
pilot project was to evaluate the effects of PIPE therapy in children
with cystic fibrosis. Three children with CF, two boys aged 6 and 14
years and one girl aged 15 years, voluntarily participated in the
experimental training program. The patients performed individualized
group exercise three times a week on alternate days for 28
consecutive weeks at an intensity of approximately 75 percent aerobic

minutes) to 60 (3 x 20 minutes) minutes while the rest period after
each exercise was constant at two minutes. PIPE training resulted in
increased physical work capacity and maximal oxygen consumption in
all three subjects. Curiously, these changes were not accompanied by
training bradycardia.

Individual prediction at the time of diagnosis is impossible, but

Texto: Some of the serum proteins which bind to heparin and contribute to
the pH 5.57 "heparin binding capacity" of human serum are
glycoproteins; those from cystic fibrosis serum were found to be 27%

content, and 31% lower in hexose content when compared to heparin-
precipitated serum glycoproteins from normal control subjects.
Hexosamine content of the heparin-precipitated serum glycoproteins
was the same. Results of this preliminary investigation indicate that
altered carbohydrate composition in serum glycoproteins may affect

Texto: Lung lavage samples from rats treated in a chronic fashion with
reserpine had mean increases of 133, 170, and 120% in the total
protein, lipid, and carbohydrate contents, respectively, when
compared with those of untreated control animals, when these values
were expressed in terms of body weight.  An acute single ip
injection of the beta-adrenergic agent isoproterenol (10 mg)
increased the glycoprotein content of pulmonary lavage fluid from
control rats approximately 15-19%, but only 9-10% in those from
reserpine treated rats.  By contrast, pilocarpine (10 mg),
administered in the same manner, caused a 15% increase in the total
protein, carbohydrate, and lipid content of lavage samples from
control rats and increased these same constituents in the lavage
samples of reserpine treated rats 98, 102, and 80%, respectively.
The increased  total carbohydrate content in the lavage samples of
the treated animals was not associated with changes in the percent
distribution of neutral sugars, amino sugars, or sialic acid.  The
ratio of these various sugar components did not change in the lavage
samples of control or reserpine treated rats upon stimulation with
either pilocarpine or isoproterenol.  The increased total lipid
content fround in the lavage samples from the treated rats probably
results from an increase in phospholipids.  A decrease in
phospholipid content occurred in the lavage samples of reserpine
treated rats upon stimulation, while the opposite was observed in
those of control animals.  Chronic treatment of rats with reserpine,
thus, appears to induce an enhanced production of glycoproteins in
the airways and to interfere with phospholipid metabolism in the
lung.  In addition, the drug treatment enhances the secretory
response to pilocarpine in comparison with the responses of control
animals.  The enhanced response or hypersecretion of glycoproteins
is a quantitative one and does not seem to involve alterations in
the ratios or distribution of the various sugar components.  This
disturbance in the secretory function of the respiratory tract, a
target organ which is prominently involved in cystic fibrosis (CF)
together with alterations in other exocrine glands which resemble
those of CF patients, makes the reserpine treated rat a useful model
for further study of possible pathogenetic mechanisms in CF.  The
experimental animal model for CF developed by the chronic
administration of reserpine to rats has been found to have changes
in the protein content of lung lavage samples, in addition to
morphologic and secretory alterations in the salivary glands and the
pancreas.  Further analysis of the organic composition of lung
lavage samples shows that the protein, carbohydrate, and lipid
contents are significantly increased after chronic reserpine
administration and that the response to stimulation with pilocarpine
is enhanced in the treated animals when compared to that of
untreated control rats.  It therefore appears that chronic reserpine
administration causes a hypersecretion of glycoproteins and changes
in lipid metabolism in the respiratory tract of the rat and that, in
conjunction with previous findings in other exocrine glands, these
effects on lung function make the reserpine treated rat a useful
tool for the study of the pathologic disturbance seen in the major
exocrine glands affected in CF.

Texto: The retrograde perfusion assay in the rat parotid gland was used to
investigate the effects of salivary secretions from control and
reserpine-treated rats on Na+ reabsorption. Results demonstrated that
submaxillary saliva from the treated animals caused a 69% inhibition
of Na+ reabsorption, accompanied by a 28% reduction in the volume of
saliva secreted, and a 22% reduction in flow rate. By contrast,
submaxillary saliva from control rats caused a 6% inhibition of Na+
reabsorption, a 6% reduction in volume, and a 5% reduction in flow
rate. Parotid saliva from reserpine-treated rats also inhibited Na+
reabsorption to the extent of 39% and caused a 38% reduction in
volume and a 33% reduction in flow. Parotid saliva from control rats
only inhibited Na+ reabsorption to the extent of 2.7% and caused a 4--
6% reduction in salivary volumes and flow rates. The inhibition of
Na+ reabsorption and the reduction in salivary volume and flow rates
caused by submaxillary saliva of reserpine-treated rats were either
abolished or significantly reduced when the saliva was previously
heated to 100 degrees C, frozen, and then thawed or kept in glass
tubes at 4 degrees C for 24 hr. These results indicate that saliva
from reserpine-treated rats have comparable effects in this assay
system to those of saliva from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and
further support its use as an animal model for this disease.

Texto: Sera from patients with cystic fibrosis of the pancreas (CF) and
normal human sera were assayed for the ability to inhibit sodium-
dependent glucose transport in rat brush-border membrane vesicles.
Fresh CF and age- and sex-matched control sera were both inhibitory
when compared to physiologic saline. The inhibition by CF serum was
44 +/- 13% (mean +/- SD) at a final serum concentration of 6.7%, 67
+/- 34% at 10% serum, and 68 +/- 28% at 20% serum. The ratio of the
inhibition of CF sera compared to that of control sera was 1.00,
0.78, and 0.93 at 6.7, 10, and 20% serum concentrations,
respectively. Although a slightly greater inhibition by CF serum was
observed at a concentration of 10%, this is probably not significant
because no difference could be detected at a concentration of 20%
serum. Glucose transport in the presence of serum was sensitive to
phlorizin indicating that the residual glucose transport was
proceeding by the sodium-dependent glucose transport system. These
findings suggest that CF serum does not specifically inhibit the
sodium-dependent glucose transport system. The intravesicular space
accessible to glucose was reduced in the presence of CF or control
serum. Fresh CF serum was 1.4 times more effective than fresh control
serum (P less than 0.01). The presence of substantial vesicle-
shrinking activity in control serum indicates that this activity
cannot be considered specific for CF.

Texto: The importance of intracellular calcium (Ca) in secretion and
transmembrane ion movement led us to study Ca in cells from patients
with cystic fibrosis (CF) which is a lethal genetic exocrinopathy.
Skin fibroblasts from patients with CF, obligate heterozygotes (HZ),
and age- and sex-matched controls (C) were used in matched pair
experiments measuring 45Ca exchange into and efflux from the cells
over time. CF cell lines and HZ cell lines exhibit increased 45Ca
exchange when compared with their respective controls (P less than
0.005). The magnitude of this difference (approximately 30%) is not
reduced when cells are washed with lanthanum chloride after the
exchange period. This difference is likely attributable to an altered
capacity of one or more of the intracellular Ca sequestering
organelles. Further evidence for this explanation was seen in 45Ca
efflux experiments in which CF cells retained a higher percent of
their initial 0-time 45Ca than did C cells late in the efflux period
(P less than 0.05). The finding of an altered Ca pool size in both CF
and particularly HZ cells suggests that altered Ca metabolism is
related to the basic gene defect in CF.

immunoelectrophoresis and Ouchterlony double diffusion revealed no
qualitative differences between the two alpha 2-M preparations.
Trypsin-esterase activity assayed with BAPNA as a substrate, in the
presence of an excess STI, gave similar ratios between total and
active alpha 2M. These alpha 2M-trypsin complexes were equally stable
under various experimental conditions and maintained a constant STI
non-inhibited esterase activity. Normal and CF-alpha 2M-trypsin
complexes were taken up by normal human fibroblasts to a similar
extent during a four hour period. The only significant difference was
observed when the uptake of alpha 2M from untreated sera was
examined. The uptake of alpha 2M from CF sera was always lower than
from pooled control sera despite large variation. Mixing of control
and CF serum did not affect the normal uptake and other serum
components were taken up to the normal extent. Intracellular
degradation of CF alpha 2M had a half life of 2.0 to 2.8 hours, which
compares well to the normal half life of 2.2 hours. More work needs
to be done on the nature of the interaction between alpha 2M and
proteases before a reasonable explanation for the molecular nature of
the abnormal behavior can be sought.

presence of an inhibitory activity in cystic fibrosis (CF) serum
which impairs phagocytosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa by rabbit as
well as human alveolar macrophages. Of the 49 patient serum samples

phagocytosis of S. aureus and S. marcescens was found not to be
inhibited by CF serum. Mixing of CF serum with normal serum could not
overcome the inhibitory effect, indicating the presence of an
inhibitory factor rather than the lack of a necessary component. The
inhibitory activity is not lost upon exposure of serum to glass, upon
freezing the serum once, or upon heating at 56 degrees C for 30

Texto: Serum ciliotoxic activity (SCA), which had been described in cystic
fibrosis (CF), was studied in mutant mice with some hereditary
alterations resembling this inherited disease. A test was developed
to detect SCA in biologic fluids by means of a natural vibratile
system; it consisted in the incubation of mouse sperm with different
CF serum dilutions under controlled conditions, in order to determine
the sperm translation cessation time (STCT) and the sperm activity
cessation time (SACT). As the findings of this study were similar to
those obtained by other authors who have been employing alternative
systems, it was decided to apply this method on mice serum. Sera were
obtained from male and female 3- to 4-wk-old mice of DBA/2J-cri,
C57BL/6J-bgJ, and BALB/c inbred strains; SCA was investigated in
affected homozygotes and their +/? siblings were used as controls.
Male 8- to 16-wk-old BALB/c mice were employed as sperm donors.
Significant differences were found between cri/cri and +/? mice of
the DBA/2J-cri strain in both STCT and SACT determinations at 1/10
serum dilution. It is concluded that mouse sperm is a system
sensitive enough to detect SCA in biologic fluids from human beings.
Likewise, the test of the mouse sperm allowed us to detect SCA in
cri/cri mice, turning this mutation into a possible animal model for
CF.

relatives of CF patients , and 159 controls have been incubated with
porcine or bovine 125I-trypsin, electrophoresed on polyacrylamide
gel, and autoradiographed. In these individuals, the main binding
protein for 125I-trypsin has been shown to be alpha 2-macroglobulin
(alpha 2M). Using this method of analysis, no difference in
electrophoretic migration of 125I-trypsin-alpha 2M complexes has been
observed between CF and control individuals. However, trypsin binding
to IgG has been observed in 80% of CF patients, 30% of their mothers,
3% of controls, and in two patients affected with pancreatitis. These
trypsin binding immunoglobulins are called TbIg, and specifically,
Tb1gG when referring to the G class. Experimental evidence indicates
that binding of trypsin to IgG occurs through the Fab portion of the
molecule. Tb1gG must be antibodies most probably induced by the
exogenous trypsin ingested daily by most CF patients (and by patients
affected with chronic pancreatitis). Antibodies against porcine
pancreatic elastase have been observed using the same analysis, but
not as frequently as Tb1g.

Texto: We found that cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with pancreatic
insufficiency (PI) had a statistically lower total serum amylase
level than normal subjects, but all values were still within the
normal range.  Although we found that the absolute amount of salivary
amylase, in the serum of patients with CF and PI, was the same as
that for normal subjects, the percent of contribution was
considerably higher.  We found that the pancreas contributed
approximately 23% of the total serum amylase in CF patients with PI,
a value very similar to the 34% amount found by Kamaryt et al.  We
also found, as did Davidson et al., that CF patients without PI had
higher total serum amylase values than did normal subjects.  Thus,
we feel that Davidson et al. have misinterpreted the results of our
previous study and, in fact, we feel that Davidson et al. have
essentially confirmed our previous work by suggesting that CF
patients with pancreatic insufficiency have an increased salivary
amylase for reasons yet unknown.  Our experience has shown that,
indeed, the pancreatic portion is first increased and then decreases
as the patient with CF and apparent normal pancreatic function
progresses, with time, toward pancreatic insufficiency.  However, the
changes in serum amylase values in patients with CF are on the
average due to changes in the pancreatic contribution to the serum
and as expressed as a mean was highly significantly different for
both normal and abnormal pancreatic function.  The second important
point of our paper was that this mean variation occurred in serum
samples from patients with CF that had total amylase values within
the normal test range.  The serum salivary isoamylase in both normals
and patients with CF and PI had a higher serum salivary percent.

CF serum (relative to normal serum) was greatly increased by using
explants which were maintained 24-72 hr in minimal essential medium

optimal ciliary activity and vigor. With such a bioassay system of
guinea pig tracheal explants, incubation with 25% normal serum would
produce essentially no change in relative ciliary activity (score of
242 of a possible 300), whereas CF serum resulted in an 86% decrease
(score of 33). Scanning electron microscopic observation indicated
that the explants displaying the CF-ciliostatic effect had
significant accumulations of mucous over the ciliated epithelial
surface. A biochemical viability assay (dehydrogenase activity)
showed no cytonecrosis when CF serum-treated tissues were compared to
standard explants (10% horse serum in MEM) or control explants (25%

that the response of cilia to sera can be well characterized by laser

of ciliary activity, is a sensitive and characteristic response
produced by cystic fibrosis serum, and not by normal serum.

Texto: The records of all children in the Tucson area diagnosed as having
cystic fibrosis (CF) before the age of 12 months were reviewed to
ascertain the prevalence of metabolic alkalosis as a major presenting
manifestation of CF. Five of eleven infants (46%) in whom CF had been
diagnosed between 1 and 12 months of age initially were seen with
hypokalemia, hypochloremia, and metabolic alkalosis unassociated with
marked dehydration, hyperpyrexia, or major pulmonary and/or
gastrointestinal symptoms. Two infants had repeated episodes of
metabolic alkalosis; for one of these infants, both episodes of
metabolic alkalosis occurred before the diagnosis of CF. It is
postulated that chronic loss of sweat electrolytes together with mild
gastrointestinal or respiratory illness may predispose the infant
with cystic fibrosis to a severe electrolyte and acid-base
disturbance. The lack of shock and hyperpyrexia together with the
apparent chronicity of electrolyte losses differentiates metabolic
alkalosis from the heat prostration syndrome, a more acute
complication of cystic fibrosis. Quantitative sweat testing should be
part of the evaluation of any infant with unexplained metabolic
alkalosis. Serum electrolytes should be assessed regularly in infants
with cystic fibrosis during hot weather months.

two hypotheses can be put forth: (1) The lack of absorption of some

proteolytic enzymes with consecutive activation of phlogistic

Texto: A criticism often levelled at the forced expiration technique (FET)
is that it increases and may even produce bronchospasm.  It was our
impression that the use of forced expiration when combined with
periods of relaxed diaphragmatic breathing did not aggravate
bronchospasm and shortened the postural drainage session.  Two groups
of patients were studied: 24 with cystic fibrosis to evaluate the use
of the FET as an independent means of postural drainage; and 20
asthmatic patients to assess the effect of the FET on bronchospasm.
The studies indicate that the forced expiration technique increases
the efficiency of postural drainage, but does not increase airway
obstruction.  This technique can be applied to both medical and
surgical conditions when postural drainage, or a modified form of
postural drainage, is indicated.

Texto: A procedure is described which permits the rapid isolation of large
amounts of elastase and cathepsin G from purulent sputum. This
procedure involves: (1) digestion of sputum with DNase, (2)
extraction of the insoluble residue that remains with 1 M NaCl, pH 8,
(3) affinity chromatography on Sepharose-bound Trasylol, and (4)
separation of the two enzymes by chromatogrphy on CM-Sephadex.
Starting with 500 g of sputum it was possible to isolate 175 mg of
each of these two enzymes within 7 to 10 days. Active site titration
indicated both enzymes to be at least 97% pure. Disc gel
electrophoresis in the presence and absence of SDS and amino acid
sequence of the N-terminal region support the conclusion that the
elastase and cathepsin G isolated from sputum are identical to the
same enzymes isolated directly from the leukocytes of human blood.

Texto: We have shown that skin fibroblast from patients with cystic fibrosis
(CF) and from carriers for CF [heterozygotes (HZ)] consume more O2
than do their controls. When the mitochondrial electron transport
inhibitor rotenone was added to the cells, the relative inhibition of
O2 consumption was CF greater than HZ greater than controls (P less
than 0.005 in both comparisons). Because rotenone specifically
inhibits NADH dehydrogenase, [NADH: (acceptor) oxidoreductase, EC
1.6.99.3], which is the enzyme of energy-conserving site 1 of the
mitochondrial electron transport system, activity and kinetics of
this enzyme system were studied in fibroblast homogenates. NADH
dehydrogenase activity was equal in cells from the three genotypes.
At pH 8.0, affinity of the enzyme for its substrate was CF greater
than HZ = controls; at pH 8.6, affinity was CF greater than HZ =
controls (P less than 0.005 for the differences). pH optima for the
genotypes were without exception 8.6 (CF), 8.3 (HZ), and 8.0
(control). HZ and control lines were distinguished unequivocally in a
blind test on the basis of differences in pH optima. Purified
mitochondrial preparations revealed pH optima identical to those
found in whole cell homogenates. These data suggest that the mutant
gene responsible for CF is expressed in the complex mitochondrial
NADH dehydrogenase system.

Texto: Ten years ago, we demonstrated that chronic administration of
isoproterenol to rats results is structural and functional changes of
their salivary glands similar to those seen in exocrine glands of
patients with cystic fibrosis.  Recently, we began to study the
cellular pathophysiology of these glands and managed to achieve
pharmacological control of this abnormality.  We demonstrated that
administration of a beta-adrenergic antagonist in these animals
resulted in the correction of the electrolyte abnormality which is
very similar to that seen in the sweat glands of patients with cystic
fibrosis.  These two examples of manipulation of the secretory
processes in exocrine glands of experimental animals demonstrate the
feasibility of this approach in the therapy of patients with cystic
fibrosis.

Texto: The change of life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients has
stimulated our interest in assessing the understanding and
utilization of genetic information by adult CF patients and how this
may affect their coping mechanism(s).  The present study was designed
to obtain information in these areas with the expectation that more
effective genetic counseling might be developed for this enlarging
group of patients.  Knowledge of genetics, attitudes concerning
reproduction, attitudes toward prenatal diagnosis, and attitudes
toward a carrier identification study are reported for 25 males and
15 females with proven cystic fibrosis.

Texto: In a series of 62 cases of cystic fibrosis presenting at the
Transvaal Memorial Hospital for Children, Johannesburg, during the
10-year period 1968-1978, 15 patients required surgical treatment
for 17 complications of the disease.  Meconium ileus, rectal
prolapse, intussusception and ethmoiditis were the commonest
surgical presentations, and portal hypertension, bronchial
obstruction and nasal polyposis were also experienced.  As the basic
defect is unknown, treatment today is still directed towards these
usually unpredictable secondary consequences.

Texto: The bacteriological effect of chemotherapy against Pseudomonas
aeruginosa (Ps.ae.) in lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis is
reviewed. During a 5-year period 49 children and adults were treated
with 190 courses of different antibiotics. The mucoid strains of
Ps.ae. disappeared in 72.0% of the courses in which a combination of
tobramycin and carbenicillin was employed. Tobramycin given alone had
only bacteriological effect in 26.6% of the courses. Colimycin alone
or in combination with carbenicillin had no effect. In 18 patients
who received subsequent courses of tobramycin and combination of
tobramycin and carbenicillin a significant difference in favour of
the combination therapy was found, also in cases with many
precipitins against Ps.ae. in serum. In 74.5% of the initially
successful courses the patients were recolonized with Ps.ae. within 1
month. No nephrotoxic or ototoxic side effects were demonstrated in
spite of the high doses of tobramycin (10 mg/kg/24 h) emmployed and
the repeated courses.

Texto: Bronchial secretions from 207 children suffering from various
pulmonary diseases and from 15 healthy controls were tested
concentration of IgA, IgG, lactoferrin and lysozyme. The results
obtained suggest that in many cases of chronic lung diseases in
children the levels of lactoferrin and immunoglobulins, especially
secretory IgA, are very low. In severe infections (cystic fibrosis,
bronchiectases) significant increase of IgG concentration was
observed.

Texto: Assays based on the counting of total cells and of colony-forming
cells were used to demonstrate that neither dexamethasone nor
dibutyryl adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cyclic AMP) kills human
fibroblasts under a variety of conditions. These results contradict
those of previous studies showing that dexamethasone and dibutyryl
cyclic AMP kill a higher percentage of fibroblasts from normal humans
than from individuals with cystic fibrosis.

Texto: Cultured skin fibroblasts from subjects with cystic fibrosis
exhibited normal population doubling times in early passages. After
about 13 cumulative population doublings, cystic fibrosis lines
doubled more slowly than controls and ceased doubling after about 19
weekly passages. Control lines continued doubling for 27 passages.
The premature senescence noted in cells from subjects with cystic
fibrosis reconciles controversial observations of cell doubling
reported in the literature. Data presented here demonstrate that
experiments with cystic fibrosis cells in late passage may generate
misleading results since differences from control lines may be
ascribed to generalized senile changes rather than to specific
results of the cystic fibrosis genotype.

Texto: With the early diagnosis of cystic fibrosis and the better management
of these patients in childhood increasing numbers are surviving to
adult life. The main problem requiring continuous medical care in the
older cystic fibrosis patient is persisting and often progressive
chest disease. For this reason the cystic fibrosis clinic for
adolescents and young adults was started in the Western Infirmary in
1975. This paper presents our observations on 13 patients who had
attended between 1975 and 1977. Eleven patients are alive and well
and have shown no evidence of deterioration over this period. Ten are
at school or in regular employment. With optimum medical supervision
it is possible to give young adults with cystic fibrosis a worthwhile
existence.

Texto: This review is intended to present a brief summary of the important
areas and concepts of cystic fibrosis relevant to clinical practice,
indicating those that remain controversial and offering opinions
based on both relevant literature and the clinical experience of the
Cleveland Cystic Fibrosis Center.  The sweat test, tests of
pancreatic function, tests of pulmonary function, genetics and family
history in diagnosis, infertility as a diagnostic factor, the role of
circulating factors in diagnosis, heterozygote detection and prenatal
diagnosis, miscellaneous factors leading to diagnosis, neonatal
screening, and general observations on the diagnosis of CF are
examined.  A philosophy of treatment, physical measures,
antimicrobial therapy, aerosol therapy, the role of hospitalization
in a therapeutic program, other drug therapy, the treatment of cor
pulmonale, respiratory failure, and specific pulmonary complications
are discussed.  Enzyme replacement and obstructive phenomena, glucose
intolerance, the treatment of the sweat defect, psychosocial therapy,
and prognosis are also considered.

Texto: Apart from the sound physiologic basis for the distal splenorenal
shunt as compared with the portacaval shunt and the conventional
central splenorenal shunt, there are two important reasons why we
think the use of this type of shunt is especially advantageous in
children with portal hypertension secondary to cystic fibrosis.
Firstly, the thick, fibrotic retroperitoneal area in the porta
hepatis, where a portacaval shunt has to be constructed, can be
avoided, which makes the distal splenorenal shunt the easier
operation. Secondly, notwithstanding the relatively small-sized
vessels, a wide anastomosis can be constructed with a high flow rate
and, therefore, a minimal chance of shunt thrombosis.

Texto: Recently, we found the cystic fibrosis mucociliary inhibitor in urine
from homozygotes and heterozygotes, but not from normals.  In recent
studies we have attempted to compare the relative concentrations of
CFMI in material from homozygotes and heterozygotes.  The unites of
inhibition which reflect the concentration of the CFMI in serum and
tissue culture medium fractions from heterozygotes is close to
one-half of that in fractions from homozygous sources.  With
purification of the CFMI and the generation of a monospecific
antibody preparation, answers will become available to the questions
of whether or not there is a normal counterpart to the CFMI and
whether or not quantitation of the CFMI will be useful in
heterozygote detection and prenatal diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.

Texto: Tests claimed to detect small airway disease were evaluated in
children.  Fifty-two subjects who were normal, 30 with cystic
fibrosis (CF), and 35 with asthma were selected on the basis of
normal spirometry, informed consent being obtained from them and
their parents.  Tests undertaken were measurement of maximum
expiratory flow volume curves breathing air and a helium-oxygen
mixture, single breath nitrogen washout curves, lung volumes, and,
except in the normal subjects, measurement of arterial oxygen
tension.  Closing volumes were normal in most children with CF and
asthma, whereas the slope of the alveolar plateau was abnormal in
83%.  Maximum expiratory flow rate at 50% of total lung capacity was
reduced in 65% and maximum mid-expiratory flow rate in 57%; residual
volume increased in 51%, and results of other tests were abnormal in
less than 50% of the children.  There was evidence suggesting that
lung disease was more patchy in children with mild CF than in those
with interval phase asthma.  These tests do not detect specific
pathological processes in small airways but reflect the consequences
of small airway abnormalities, which may vary in the same disease as
well as in different diseases.  No one test alone appears most
useful.  Together they contribute to understanding the functional
abnormalities present in each individual.

Texto: We theorize that cystic fibrosis may be a disease in which a plasma
factor with lectin-like activity stimulates mucus secretion, causes
precipitation of mucus glycoproteins, and incidentally affects
lymphocytes in culture.  To confirm our theory, we planned to search
for additional lectin-like activities in CF serum.  Our experiments
suggest that the lectin-like substance in CF blood requires IgM for
its red-blood-cell-agglutination activity.  Thus, no difference in
agglutination titer is observed between CF homozygotes and
heterozygotes, because IgM is the limiting factor, and IgM
concentrations do not differ appreciably in such subjects.  We
suspect that CF homozygotes have a larger pool of free lectin in
their blood than do heterozygotes, so that quantitation of this free
lectin pool may distinguish between the two phenotypes.  Excess free
lectin may account for the signs and symptoms of CF, whereas lesser
amounts may theoretically be advantageous to the heterozygote.

Texto: In 25 children (13 male; 12 female) with cystic fibrosis aged 6
months to 16 years and 24 matched controls total serum vitamin E
levels and fatty acid patterns of serum cholesterol esters,
phospholipids and triglycerides are demonstrated. Compared to
controls (1.02 +/- 0.24 mg/dl) the total serum vitamin E levels are
significantly decreased in patients with cystic fibrosis (0.30 +/-
0.26 mg/dl) (p less than 0.01). There is no significant difference
comparing the fatty acid patterns of the serum ester fractions of
both groups. Differences can be seen best in the cholesterol ester
fraction. In this fraction linoleic acid shows a trend to be
decreased in the cystic fibrosis patients compared to the control
group. A possible influence of height velocity on the levels of
essential fatty acids is discussed.
